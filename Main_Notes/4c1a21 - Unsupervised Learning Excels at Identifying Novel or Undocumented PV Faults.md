A significant advantage of unsupervised fault detection methods is their ability to identify fault types that are novel, poorly understood, or not previously documented. 
This capability stems from their fundamental approach of detecting anomalies rather than searching for specific, pre-defined fault signatures.

Because these models define a baseline of normal operation, any significant deviation is flagged as a potential issue. 
This allows operators to discover emerging or unexpected failure modes without the need for prior data collection and labeling specific to that fault (Zhang et al., 2021).

Undetected faults in photovoltaic systems fundamentally undermine their primary function of efficient energy conversion. 
These issues, which range from component degradation to electrical imbalances, directly compromise system health and operational reliability.

When faults are not identified and rectified, they can lead to significant power losses and shorten the lifespan of the installation. 
Therefore, effective fault detection is not just for maintenance but is essential for ensuring the system's overall efficiency and longevity.

Non-invasive fault detection methods, such as those based on I-V curve analysis, perfectly illustrate the synergy between human operators and advanced ML models. 
These techniques allow for the diagnosis of various fault types without requiring significant interruption to the PV system's operation (Huang et al., 2019).

In this hybrid approach, ML models perform the initial, automated analysis of the I-V curve to detect anomalies. 
Human experts can then intervene to analyze and interpret these flagged anomalies, adding a crucial layer of reliability to the diagnostic process without the need for costly and disruptive physical inspections (Khalil et al., 2020).

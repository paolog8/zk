A powerful hybrid methodology for PV fault detection involves combining different data sources to create a more complete picture of system health. 
For instance, integrating infrared thermography (thermal images) with electrical telemetry data through a machine learning model provides a much richer basis for diagnosis (Qureshi et al., 2024).

This dual-data strategy allows the model to correlate internal electrical anomalies with external thermal patterns, leading to more effective and reliable fault identification. 
This type of data fusion is especially critical for enhancing predictive maintenance strategies in large-scale PV installations where diverse and complex faults can occur.

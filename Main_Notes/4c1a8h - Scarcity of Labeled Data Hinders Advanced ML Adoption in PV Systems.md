Tags: #LabeledData, #DataScarcity, #PVFaultDetection

A major barrier to implementing more advanced machine learning (ML) fault detection systems in PV applications is the scarcity of extensive, high-quality labeled datasets. 
While techniques like Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs) show promise, their effectiveness is contingent upon large volumes of labeled data for training (Garoudja et al., 2017; Al-Obaidi & Derbel, 2023).

Obtaining comprehensive, real-time data that covers a wide array of fault types and environmental conditions is difficult and costly. 
This data scarcity limits the ability of traditional and even some advanced models to adapt to new or previously unencountered fault scenarios, creating a bottleneck for the development of truly robust and intelligent detection systems.

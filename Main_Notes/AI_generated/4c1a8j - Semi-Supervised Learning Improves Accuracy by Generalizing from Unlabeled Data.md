Semi-supervised learning is particularly effective for PV fault detection because it is designed to learn from datasets containing a small number of labeled examples and a large number of unlabeled examples. 
This mirrors the typical data environment of real-world PV systems (Wang et al., 2023; Dai et al., 2021).

The methodology allows a model to first gain structured insights from the few labeled instances. 
It then iteratively refines and improves its accuracy by generalizing patterns from the vast pool of unlabeled data. 
This multi-stage learning process enables higher performance and more robust fault classification than relying on limited labeled data alone (Ghazali & Sujod, 2022).

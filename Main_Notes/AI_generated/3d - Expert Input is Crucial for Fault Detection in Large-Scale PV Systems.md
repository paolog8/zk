Fault detection in large-scale PV systems is uniquely challenging due to the immense complexity and interconnection of components, which can lead to numerous and varied fault types. 
Standard ML algorithms may struggle to adequately identify all potential failures in such vast systems (Pei & Hao, 2019).

Incorporating expert feedback is crucial for modeling these large-scale complexities in a way that purely algorithmic solutions might overlook. 
A cooperative relationship between the machine and the human operator allows the system's learning objectives to be refined over time, progressively improving diagnostic accuracy for the specific challenges posed by large, intricate installations.

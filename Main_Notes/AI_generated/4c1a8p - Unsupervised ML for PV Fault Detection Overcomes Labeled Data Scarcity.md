Tags: #PVFaultDetection, #UnsupervisedLearning, #DataScarcity

Unsupervised machine learning models are highly valuable for photovoltaic fault detection primarily because they do not require labeled data. 
Acquiring comprehensive labeled datasets that cover all possible fault scenarios in PV systems is often impractical due to high costs and labor intensity (Rao et al., 2021).

Unlike supervised approaches that depend on pre-labeled examples of faults, unsupervised techniques can learn from raw, unlabeled operational data. 
This makes them particularly well-suited for PV systems where labeled fault data is scarce (Ghazali & Sujod, 2022).

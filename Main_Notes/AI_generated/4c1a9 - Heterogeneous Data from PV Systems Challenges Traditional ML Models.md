Traditional machine learning (ML) models face significant challenges when applied to fault detection in photovoltaic (PV) systems due to the heterogeneous nature of the data. 
This data is a complex mix of signals influenced by fluctuating irradiance, temperature, and shading, alongside inherent noise and inconsistencies from various sensors (Hojabri et al., 2022).

This variability makes it difficult for fixed algorithms to perform reliably, as different faults can manifest uniquely under different operational states (Dhimish et al., 2017). 
Even advanced deep learning techniques require extensive preprocessing to extract relevant features from this complex data, highlighting a fundamental hurdle in creating robust detection systems (Al-Obaidi & Derbel, 2023).

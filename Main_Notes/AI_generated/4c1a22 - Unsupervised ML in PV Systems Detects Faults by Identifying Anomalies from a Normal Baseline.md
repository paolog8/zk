Unsupervised learning models identify faults in photovoltaic systems by first establishing a baseline of normal operational behavior. 
These models analyze large datasets generated during normal operation to learn the system's typical patterns and performance characteristics (Ghazali & Sujod, 2022).

Once this baseline is established, the model monitors the system for any data points or behaviors that deviate significantly from it. 
These deviations, or anomalies, are flagged as potential faults, such as unexpected changes in voltage or current, which can then be investigated further (Natsheh & Samara, 2020; Et-taleby et al., 2023).

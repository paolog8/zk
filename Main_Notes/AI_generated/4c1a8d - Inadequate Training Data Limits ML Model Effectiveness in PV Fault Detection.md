The effectiveness of machine learning (ML) models in PV fault detection is critically dependent on the quality and comprehensiveness of the training data. 
A significant challenge is that models trained on a limited set of fault types become specialized and may fail to recognize new or uncommon faults accurately (Elkalashy & Taha, 2022).

If the training dataset does not include examples of certain faults or neglects the impact of various component failures, the resulting model will have blind spots. 
This vulnerability means the model may perform well in test scenarios but fail when deployed in a real-world environment where unexpected fault conditions can and do occur.

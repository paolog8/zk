Unsupervised models are inherently limited in their ability to classify the specific type of fault occurring in a PV system. 
Since they do not train on labeled historical data, they cannot distinguish between faults like short-circuits, open-circuits, or arc faults (Rao et al., 2021; Suliman et al., 2024).

These models may successfully group anomalous data points into clusters, but these clusters lack inherent meaning. 
This leaves technicians with the knowledge that _something_ is wrong, but without the crucial information needed to take the correct remedial action (Liu et al., 2024).

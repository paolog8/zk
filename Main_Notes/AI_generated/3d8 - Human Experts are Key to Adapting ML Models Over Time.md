Purely automated machine learning strategies can lack the robustness to adapt to new or evolving fault types that emerge over the lifespan of a PV system. 
Human expertise is pivotal for the long-term success of these models by guiding their adaptation and recalibration (Tertytchny et al., 2019).

Experts can identify when a model's performance is degrading and diagnose the cause, whether it's a new type of fault or a change in operating conditions. 
By integrating this expert feedback into a continuous fine-tuning process, the hybrid system remains relevant and accurate, effectively handling the unforeseen variables common in PV operations.

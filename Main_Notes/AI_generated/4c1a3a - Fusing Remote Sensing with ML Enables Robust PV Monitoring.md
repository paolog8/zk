A promising frontier in PV fault detection is the fusion of remote sensing technologies with hybrid machine learning models. 
This approach combines remote heterogeneous data, such as thermal or optical satellite imagery, with sophisticated ML algorithms to create powerful, real-time monitoring systems (Zhang et al., 2024; Gong et al., 2023).

This integration allows for the detection of physical anomalies (like hotspots or soiling) over large areas without direct physical inspection. 
By feeding this rich, multi-modal data into an ML pipeline, it's possible to build robust diagnostic systems that operate with minimal human intervention, meeting the growing demand for automated, real-time performance monitoring.

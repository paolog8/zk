Artificial intelligence and machine learning are becoming crucial for ensuring the reliability of PV systems. These technologies enable the development of advanced diagnostic tools that can monitor a system in real-time.

By using sensors and ML algorithms, these systems can learn a PV plant's normal operating behavior. This allows them to detect subtle deviations that indicate an emerging fault, providing an opportunity for predictive maintenance before a significant failure occurs. This early detection greatly enhances operational safety and reliability.

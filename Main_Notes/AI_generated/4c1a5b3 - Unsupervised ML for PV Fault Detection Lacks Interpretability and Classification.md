Unsupervised machine learning models are effective for identifying anomalies in photovoltaic system data without needing pre-labeled examples. 
However, their primary weakness lies in their inability to explain _why_ an anomaly was flagged or to classify the specific _type_ of fault.

This limitation hinders effective decision-making and operational management of PV systems (Voutsinas et al., 2023). 
While they can detect deviations, they cannot inherently provide the actionable insights needed for targeted maintenance.

Transfer learning is a vital hybrid technique for overcoming the common problem of limited labeled data in PV fault detection. 
This approach leverages knowledge from a model pre-trained on a large, well-labeled dataset and applies it to a new, smaller dataset specific to a particular fault diagnosis task (Xu et al., 2020).

By fine-tuning a pre-trained deep learning model on the limited available fault data, researchers can achieve high diagnostic accuracy without the need to build a new model from scratch. 
This method significantly enhances a model's ability to provide actionable diagnostics in novel contexts where collecting extensive labeled data is impractical (Mansouri et al., 2021).

A hybrid approach that integrates human expertise with machine learning (ML) algorithms is essential for creating robust and reliable fault detection systems for photovoltaic (PV) systems. 
The complexity of PV operations means that automated models alone can be insufficient (Mellit et al., 2021).

Human experts provide crucial oversight and domain-specific insights that refine and validate the performance of ML models like Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) (Dhimish et al., 2018). 
This synergy between automated analysis and human evaluation is necessary to handle the diverse and evolving challenges in real-world PV fault detection, enhancing both accuracy and trustworthiness.

Faults within a photovoltaic system can originate from several distinct sources. 
These include the physical failure of PV modules, operational inefficiencies in the inverter, and the gradual wear and tear of electrical connections.

These individual component issues can collectively reduce the system's overall energy generation. 
The resulting inefficiencies may not be immediately obvious during casual observation, allowing them to persist and worsen over time.

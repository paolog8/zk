Traditional supervised machine learning approaches for photovoltaic fault detection are significantly challenged by the high costs and logistical hurdles associated with data. 
The necessity for extensive, accurately labeled datasets creates a primary barrier to entry and effective deployment.

Acquiring and labeling data for the wide array of potential faults is a resource-intensive process. 
This fundamental difficulty complicates the development of robust models and underscores the need for methods that are less dependent on perfectly curated datasets.

Inadequate investment in grid infrastructure is a critical bottleneck for accelerating renewable energy deployment. 
This challenge is widespread across all country clusters and leads to long connection queues. 
Greater system flexibility is needed to integrate variable renewable energy sources cost-effectively. 
Governments must prioritize modernizing regulatory frameworks and aligning transmission and distribution grid planning to address these issues.

Beyond power loss and economic impact, undetected faults in PV systems pose serious safety risks. 
If not addressed, minor issues can escalate into catastrophic failures with dangerous consequences.

Specific hazards include the formation of "hot spots" on modules, often due to cell mismatches, which can become a fire risk. 
Furthermore, deteriorating wiring or faulty connections can lead to electrical shock hazards, endangering maintenance personnel and property.

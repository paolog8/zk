Standard machine learning models may not be sensitive enough to adequately detect incipient or subtle faults in their early stages. 
Human oversight is critical to complement these automated systems by providing the contextual knowledge needed to identify these developing issues (Sairam et al., 2020).

An expert can recognize faint patterns or minor deviations that an algorithm might dismiss as noise, especially if they have historical knowledge of the system's behavior. 
This combination of automated screening and human validation significantly reduces response times and enhances the overall effectiveness of predictive maintenance efforts (Sairam et al., 2020; Al-Obaidi & Derbel, 2023).

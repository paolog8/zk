The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies is vital for effective hybrid fault detection systems in PV installations. 
IoT devices generate vast streams of real-time operational data, which can be processed by ML algorithms to yield immediate, actionable insights (Lazzaretti et al., 2020; Samkria et al., 2021).

This creates a continuous feedback loop between the automated system and human operators. 
The system flags potential issues in real-time, and operators can quickly validate and respond. 
This synergy minimizes the risk of overlooking critical faults and significantly accelerates the response to identified problems, enhancing overall system reliability.

A promising strategy to overcome the limitations of purely unsupervised models is to implement a hybrid design. 
This approach leverages the strengths of both unsupervised and supervised learning in a two-step process.

First, an unsupervised model is used to scan operational data and flag any anomalies, which it can do without labeled data. 
Second, a supervised classification model, trained on any available labeled fault data, is used to categorize the specific anomalies detected by the first model (Lin et al., 2025). 
This method bridges the gap between anomaly detection and fault classification, creating a more effective and actionable system.

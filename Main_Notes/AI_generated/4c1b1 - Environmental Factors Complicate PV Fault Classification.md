The challenge of classifying PV faults with unsupervised models is made even more difficult by environmental factors. 
Conditions such as partial shading from clouds or physical soiling of panels create fault signatures that are highly variable and dependent on local conditions (Zhang et al., 2021).

An unsupervised model that is not designed to explicitly account for these complex and dynamic environmental inputs will have limited success in accurately classifying the anomalies it detects. 
What might be classified as a component failure could simply be the effect of a passing cloud, leading to inaccurate diagnoses.

Machine learning (ML) for fault detection in photovoltaic systems is challenged by high-dimensional and complex sensor data. 
The multitude of interacting environmental and electrical parameters generates convoluted datasets that complicate accurate modeling.

These characteristics increase computational demands and elevate the risk of model overfitting, where the model learns noise instead of true patterns (Badr et al., 2021; Et-taleby et al., 2023). 
Effectively managing these data challenges is crucial for developing reliable ML-based fault detection systems.

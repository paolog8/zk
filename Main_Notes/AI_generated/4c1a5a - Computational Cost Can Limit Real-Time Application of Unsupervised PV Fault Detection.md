The computational complexity associated with certain unsupervised algorithms can be a significant barrier to their use in real-time fault detection for PV systems. 
Processing the large volumes of high-frequency data generated by PV arrays can be resource-intensive.

This high computational demand may make some unsupervised methods impractical for immediate, on-the-fly fault detection where rapid responses are necessary. 
The feasibility of these models in real-time applications often depends on the available computing power and the efficiency of the specific algorithm chosen (Natsheh & Samara, 2020).

To overcome the limitations of purely supervised methods, there is a significant shift towards semi-supervised and unsupervised learning for PV fault detection. 
These approaches are powerful because they can utilize the vast amounts of unlabeled operational data generated by PV systems.

By learning from both a small set of labeled data and a large set of unlabeled data, semi-supervised models can achieve high performance without the prohibitive cost and effort of extensive manual labeling. 
This makes them a practical and cost-effective solution for bridging the data-scarcity gap in real-world applications.

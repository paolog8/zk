The process of acquiring high-quality data for PV fault detection is inherently complex and requires significant resources. 
Faults are often identified through indirect indicators like power loss or voltage errors, which necessitates the use of precisely calibrated sensors and robust data collection protocols.

This complexity is magnified by the potential for sensor error, such as a misaligned pyranometer providing inaccurate solar irradiation data. 
Correcting for such issues adds another layer of difficulty and cost to the data acquisition process, making it a major operational challenge for large-scale PV systems.

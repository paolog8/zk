Even advanced machine learning models like CNNs can fall short in ambiguous fault scenarios where algorithmic interpretation is unclear. 
Human expertise is essential in these cases to provide oversight and prevent misdiagnoses that could lead to costly operational errors (Sairam et al., 2020; Eskandari et al., 2020).

By complementing automated analysis with human judgment, hybrid systems gain a layer of reliability. 
Experts can contextualize ambiguous outputs, validate model predictions against their domain knowledge, and ensure that the final diagnostic decision is sound, which is particularly important for complex or novel fault types.

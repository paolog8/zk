The consequences of undetected faults in a PV system extend directly to its economic viability. 
As faults cause the system to degrade and underperform, the resulting energy yield diminishes, which negatively impacts the return on investment (ROI).

These economic losses are not limited to large-scale installations. 
Smaller PV systems can be especially vulnerable if they are not regularly monitored, as performance decline may be overlooked. 
This can also affect warranty claims and reduce energy credits, adding further financial strain.

Effective monitoring of a photovoltaic system is a critical tool for managing and enforcing warranty agreements. Equipment warranties are often contingent on the system meeting specific performance benchmarks and operational standards.

Proactive monitoring creates a continuous and detailed log of the system's performance, providing clear evidence that these contractual benchmarks are being met. This documentation is invaluable for substantiating warranty claims if a component fails or underperforms, thereby protecting the owner's financial investment.

A core challenge for unsupervised machine learning models in photovoltaic fault detection is their inability to reliably distinguish between critical system faults and benign, normal variations in operational performance. 
These models can flag anomalies but often lack the necessary context to determine if a deviation is a genuine threat or a harmless fluctuation (Raslan & Çam, 2020).

This fundamental difficulty can lead to misinterpretation of alerts. 
It underscores the limitation of relying purely on statistical methods without incorporating more nuanced domain knowledge about the system's operational environment and fault characteristics.

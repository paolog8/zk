A primary challenge in developing machine learning models for photovoltaic (PV) fault detection is the scarcity of labeled fault data. 
This limitation has spurred a shift towards hybrid and semi-supervised learning techniques that leverage the vast amounts of available unlabeled data alongside the limited labeled samples (Jaskie et al., 2021; Et-taleby et al., 2023).

Faults from shading, soiling, or damage can reduce PV energy production by over 27% (Jaskie et al., 2021). 
Traditional supervised models struggle because real-world PV arrays have few faulty instances for training. 
Hybrid methods overcome this by combining supervised and unsupervised paradigms, creating a more nuanced and effective framework for fault diagnosis.

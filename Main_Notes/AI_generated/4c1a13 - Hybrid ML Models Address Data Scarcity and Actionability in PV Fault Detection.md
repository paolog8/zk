Hybrid machine learning (ML) models are a pivotal strategy for improving fault detection in photovoltaic (PV) systems. 
They are necessary to overcome two key challenges: the scarcity of labeled fault data and the need for diagnostic results that are actionable for maintenance teams.

By combining different techniques, such as deep learning for feature extraction and traditional ML for classification, these models can enhance diagnostic accuracy and robustness. 
This approach creates more reliable and effective fault detection systems that are not solely dependent on massive, often unavailable, labeled datasets.

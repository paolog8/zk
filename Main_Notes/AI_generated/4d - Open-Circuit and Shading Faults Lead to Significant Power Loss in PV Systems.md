Specific types of faults have distinct and damaging effects on a PV system's output. 
For example, an open-circuit fault within a string of modules can halt all power generation from that entire string.

Similarly, shading faults, where portions of the array are blocked from sunlight, result in uneven energy production. 
This imbalance not only reduces immediate output but also contributes to the long-term degradation of system performance.

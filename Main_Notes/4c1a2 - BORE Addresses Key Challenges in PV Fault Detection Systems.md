BORE's characteristics suggest strong potential for its application to PV fault detection systems. 
PV systems often face challenges such as imbalanced data (faults are rare), the need to detect novel anomaly types, and real-time processing constraints. BORE is designed to handle these issues, making it a suitable candidate for reliable, budget-conscious PV monitoring systems.

* Connects to: [[Photovoltaic System Monitoring]] (Relevant for energy systems management).
* Connects to: [[Anomaly Detection in Energy Systems]] (This is a specific application domain for BORE).
* Potential future connections: Investigate specific PV fault characteristics (e.g., transient vs. persistent, known vs. unknown fault types) to map directly to BORE's strengths. Explore how BORE's budget-aware feature selection could be empirically evaluated for PV systems requiring real-time diagnosis.

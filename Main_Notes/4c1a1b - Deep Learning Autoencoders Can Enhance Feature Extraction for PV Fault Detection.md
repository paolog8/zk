One potential solution to improve PV fault classification is to use deep learning models like autoencoders for advanced feature extraction. 
Autoencoders can process raw operational data and learn to represent it in a more condensed and meaningful way, potentially capturing subtle patterns that distinguish different fault types (Liu et al., 2024).

However, the success of this approach hinges on the quality of the learned features. 
To improve classification accuracy, the features extracted by the model must be sufficiently discriminative to resolve the nuanced differences between various fault conditions (Qiao et al., 2024).

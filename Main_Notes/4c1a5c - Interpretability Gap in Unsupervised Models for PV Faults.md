A significant challenge with using unsupervised learning for PV fault detection is the difficulty in interpreting the results. 
Models like one-class SVM or clustering can flag data that deviates from a normal operational baseline but do not intrinsically explain the physical cause of the anomaly (Voutsinas et al., 2023).

This "interpretability gap" means operators receive an alert without understanding the underlying issue. 
To make the model's findings actionable, the system often requires additional interpretative frameworks or the integration of human expert knowledge to translate the abstract anomaly signal into a concrete maintenance task.

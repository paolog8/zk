Human experts are invaluable in hybrid fault detection systems because they provide context that raw data alone cannot convey. 
While ML models are trained on large datasets, these datasets may not capture every operational nuance of a PV system (Et-taleby et al., 2023; Garoudja et al., 2017).

Domain specialists can interpret the impact of unique environmental factors, understand historical anomalies, and recognize subtle operational regimes. 
This expert knowledge helps inform and refine ML models, ensuring their predictions are grounded in the physical reality of the specific PV installation, which ultimately improves diagnostic accuracy.

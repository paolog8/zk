The operational environment of a photovoltaic (PV) system is not static. 
System configurations can change, and new, previously unseen fault types can emerge over time. 
This dynamic nature poses a challenge for supervised learning models, which may experience performance degradation as the real-world conditions diverge from their original training data.

To maintain accuracy and reliability, these models require constant retraining with newly collected and labeled data. 
This creates a continuous cycle of resource expenditure, as the costs associated with data acquisition and labeling are not a one-time investment but an ongoing operational necessity.

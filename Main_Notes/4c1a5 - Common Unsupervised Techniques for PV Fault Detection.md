Several unsupervised machine learning techniques are applied to discern normal from faulty behavior in photovoltaic (PV) systems. 
These methods analyze performance metrics without needing prior fault labels.

Commonly used techniques include one-class support vector machines (SVM), principal component analysis (PCA), and various clustering algorithms. 
For instance, PCA can be used to reduce the dimensionality of data and identify deviations, while clustering can group data points to separate normal operational states from anomalous ones, indicating potential faults (Natsheh & Samara, 2020; Et-taleby et al., 2023).

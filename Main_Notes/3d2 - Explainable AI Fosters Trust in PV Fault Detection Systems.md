As PV systems increasingly rely on artificial intelligence (AI) for fault diagnosis, there is a strong demand for explainability. 
Explainable AI (XAI) frameworks allow human operators to understand the underlying rationale behind the decisions made by complex ML models (Sairam et al., 2020).

This transparency is crucial for building trust in the automated system. 
When operators can see _why_ a model has flagged a potential fault, they are better equipped to make informed decisions and take appropriate action. 
Systems like the eXplainable Fault Detection and Diagnosis System (XFDDS) exemplify how XAI can enhance human involvement and confidence in PV fault management (Sairam et al., 2020; Lazzaretti et al., 2020).

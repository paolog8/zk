While supervised machine learning is a powerful approach for fault detection in photovoltaic systems, its effectiveness is fundamentally constrained by its dependence on large, well-labeled datasets. 
The process of collecting and accurately labeling data for the myriad of potential faults is both costly and labor-intensive.

This dependency creates a significant practical bottleneck. 
The difficulty in obtaining comprehensive labeled datasets that cover all operational and environmental conditions limits the real-world efficacy and reliability of purely supervised fault detection models.

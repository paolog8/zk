Fully automated fault detection in PV systems is complicated by the nuances of operational data. 
Purely automated ML models can struggle to distinguish true faults from complex operational variations or sensor noise, necessitating human intervention.

A "human-in-the-loop" approach, where an expert validates the findings of the ML model, is often required to ensure accuracy (Ghazali & Sujod, 2022). 
While this improves reliability, it hinders full automation and can slow down the fault management process, reducing overall system efficiency.

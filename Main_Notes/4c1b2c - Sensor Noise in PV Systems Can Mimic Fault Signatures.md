Noise within sensor data is a significant obstacle for machine learning algorithms in PV systems. 
Transient environmental factors, such as a cloud momentarily passing over a panel, can cause fluctuations in the data that closely mimic the signature of a genuine equipment fault (Punitha et al., 2024; Syed et al., 2024).

This similarity can easily mislead a fault detection model into making an incorrect classification. 
As a result, the system may generate a false alarm, flagging a benign event as a critical failure and prompting unnecessary investigation or maintenance actions.

Over 76% of electrical grid failures are caused by electrical grid quality issues. Have a high average energy loss per failure. Mean time to repair (MTR) is low due to utility experience.                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

|                          | **Inverter Failures (TFI)**                                                                                                                                                         | Account for **27.55% of total FEL**.                                                                                                                         | Examples include **operation failures** (e.g., IGBT failure, surge protection, overheating, AC/DC contactors, electrolytic capacitors, fuses, control software, power supply issues) and **start-up and stopping failures**. Inverters with power ≤ 15 kW had the highest number of failures, but their incidence on energy losses did not exceed 1.5% of total FEL. Approximately 14% of inverter failures are due to their own monitoring system, which do not significantly affect energy production.                                          |
|                          | **Solar Field Failures (TFSF)**                                                                                                                                                     | Represent **only 4.26% of all FEL**.                                                                                                                         | Examples include **PV module failures leading to replacement** (glass broken, major delamination, hot spots, internal circuitry failure, solder bond failure, diode failure), **DC wiring failures**, and **junction box failures**. Most failures are from module replacements, but these only account for 20% of solar field energy losses; wiring and junction box failures have a higher influence on energy losses within the solar field. Solar field has the highest mean time to repair, but low energy losses due to low affected power. |

Over 54% of these failures had a duration of less than 1 hour. In **most cases, these failures were automatically repaired by their own monitoring system**. They have the **lowest mean time to repair**. Examples include failures in the global communication system, data acquisition equipment, and inverter monitoring system.                                                                                     |

These can often be corrected (e.g., cleaning solar field, moving shadows, improving inverter ventilation).

These are inherent to the design and nominal operation conditions and are difficult to improve once the PV plant is operational.                                                                                                                                                                                                                    |

Tags: #PVEfficiency, #ProactiveMonitoring, #AnomalyDetection

Proactive monitoring is essential for maintaining high energy production efficiency in photovoltaic systems. Through the constant assessment of system performance and output, operators can quickly detect anomalies that indicate a loss in efficiency.

Common causes for such losses include environmental factors like panel soiling or shading, as well as internal operational faults. Early detection enables prompt corrective actions, which restores the system to its optimal performance level and maximizes financial returns, a crucial factor in large-scale solar farms.

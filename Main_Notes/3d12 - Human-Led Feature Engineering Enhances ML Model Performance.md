A synergistic hybrid strategy involves leveraging human expertise during the initial stages of feature engineering before training a machine learning model. 
In this approach, domain experts use their knowledge to select and transform the most relevant input variables from raw data.

This human-led feature extraction is then combined with ML algorithms like decision trees or support vector machines (SVMs), which excel at finding complex patterns within well-structured data (Yousefi et al., 2023; Balaji et al., 2024). 
This collaboration ensures that the model's learning process is guided by expert knowledge, which enhances accountability, accelerates fault resolution, and improves overall diagnostic accuracy.

Machine learning models trained on inadequate labeled data for photovoltaic fault detection often exhibit poor generalization. 
This means they perform poorly when encountering fault conditions that were not well-represented in their limited training data.

This issue stems from datasets that are either too small or lack examples of all potential fault types, leading to inherent biases in the model. 
As a result, these models are prone to high rates of false positives and false negatives in real-world applications, making their diagnostic output unreliable.

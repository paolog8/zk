To address the challenge of limited labeled data for PV fault detection, researchers are increasingly turning to unsupervised and semi-supervised learning techniques. 
These methods do not require extensive, pre-labeled datasets to identify anomalies.

By learning the patterns of normal system operation directly from unlabeled operational data, unsupervised models can detect deviations that may indicate a fault. 
This approach bypasses the bottleneck of manual data labeling, allowing for the development of robust detection systems even when labeled fault examples are scarce.

Photovoltaic systems operate in highly dynamic environments where fluctuating weather conditions can significantly impact performance and complicate fault detection. 
To be effective, ML models must be able to adapt to these changes without needing constant, extensive retraining (Seo et al., 2023).

Hybrid ML techniques enable an adaptive learning paradigm where models can learn from both historical and real-time data. 
This allows the system to continuously adjust its understanding of "normal" operation as conditions change. 
Such adaptability is crucial for maintaining high accuracy and reliability, ultimately making solar energy solutions more robust and efficient.

For a hybrid human-ML approach to be effective, visualization tools are essential. 
These tools play a critical role in translating complex anomaly data and opaque model outputs into intuitive and understandable representations for human operators (Xia et al., 2020).

Effective visualizations enable stakeholders to quickly grasp fault patterns, make more informed maintenance decisions, and build trust in the automated system. 
Furthermore, this interaction creates a powerful feedback loop where operators can validate or correct model findings, which in turn helps to continuously refine both the ML algorithm and the operators' own knowledge base (Dhanraj et al., 2021).

Beyond technical performance, a crucial driver for adopting hybrid ML methodologies in the PV sector is cost-effectiveness. 
Sophisticated hybrid architectures lead to significant operational savings by enabling earlier and more reliable fault detection (Ali et al., 2021).

By accurately identifying potential issues before they escalate into major failures, these systems reduce costly system downtime and streamline maintenance efforts. 
The integration of remote monitoring tools with real-time hybrid analytics further supports this by allowing for timely, targeted interventions that ensure the long-term efficiency and durability of PV installations (Dhanraj et al., 2021).

A key benefit of hybrid models in PV fault detection is their potential to improve the interpretability of complex predictions. 
By using a mixed-model architecture, practitioners can gain actionable insights from otherwise "black box" algorithms.

This can be achieved by pairing a powerful data analysis model (like a deep neural network) with a simpler model or statistical technique focused on explanation. 
For example, blending statistical process control with machine learning not only detects faults but also provides understandable outputs that can directly guide maintenance decisions, bridging the gap between detection and action (Harrou et al., 2018).

One promising method to overcome the lack of labeled fault data in PV systems is the use of digital twins to generate synthetic data. 
A digital twin is a virtual model of a physical PV installation that can simulate its behavior under various conditions.

By using deep learning within these simulations, researchers can model numerous fault scenarios and generate large amounts of corresponding data. 
This synthetic data can then be used to augment real-world datasets, allowing for the training of more robust and accurate machine learning models that are exposed to a wider variety of fault conditions than what is available from physical data collection alone.

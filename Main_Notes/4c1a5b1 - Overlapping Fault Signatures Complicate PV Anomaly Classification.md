A primary reason unsupervised models struggle to classify PV faults is that different fault types often exhibit similar electrical signatures, especially in their early stages. 
Conditions like short-circuits, open-circuits, and degradation can produce overlapping patterns in operational data, such as current-voltage (I-V) characteristics (Suliman et al., 2024).

Because these models rely solely on analyzing the data's features to find deviations, they cannot easily distinguish between two different problems that look alike from a data perspective. 
This inherent ambiguity leads to misclassifications and undermines the reliability of the fault detection system.

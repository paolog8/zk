  abstract = {In recent years, the overwhelming growth of solar photovoltaics (PV) energy generation as an alternative to conventional fossil fuel generation has encouraged the search for efficient and more reliable operation and maintenance practices, since PV systems require constant maintenance for consistent generation efficiency. One option, explored recently, is artificial intelligence (AI) to replace conventional maintenance strategies. The growing importance of AI in various real-life applications, especially in solar PV applications, cannot be over-emphasized. This study presents an extensive review of AI-based methods for fault detection and diagnosis in PV systems. It explores various fault types that are common in PV systems and various AI-based fault detection and diagnosis techniques proposed in the literature. Of note, there are currently fewer literatures in this area of PV application as compared to the other areas. This is due to the fact that the topic has just recently been explored, as evident in the oldest paper we could obtain, which dates back to only about 15 years. Furthermore, the study outlines the role of AI in PV operation and maintenance, and the main contributions of the reviewed literatures.}

  abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) array fault diagnosis is important because it helps reduce energy and revenue losses to PV system operators. It also reduces fire hazards and electric shocks caused by PV array faults. As a result, many machine-learning-based fault diagnosis techniques have been proposed in recent times. Although the fault diagnosis accuracies associated with these techniques have been impressive, most machine learning algorithms rely on manual feature extraction, which is time consuming, expensive, and diagnostic expertise exacting. To address the problem of manual feature extraction, this paper proposes a new PV array fault diagnosis technique capable of automatically extracting features from raw data for PV array fault classification. The proposed technique utilizes long short-term memory networks, which is a deep learning algorithm, for feature extraction. The extracted features feed into a softmax regression classifier for fault diagnosis. The proposed technique exhibits high fault diagnosis accuracies on both noisy and noiseless data. In addition, the results of the proposed technique compare favorably with those of other techniques. It can, therefore, be inferred from the results that the proposed fault diagnosis technique offers an effective approach to automatically extract useful features from raw data and thus remove the need for the manual feature extraction.}

Consequently, installation and utilization of PV power systems have seen much growth in recent years. Although PV arrays of such systems are robust, they are not immune to faults. To guarantee reliable power supply, economic returns, and safety of both humans and equipment, highly accurate fault detection, diagnosis, and interruption devices are required. In this paper, an overview of four major PV array faults and their causes are presented. Specifically, ground fault, line-line fault, arc fault, and hot spot fault have been covered. Next, conventional and advanced fault detection and diagnosis (FDD) techniques for managing these faults are reviewed. Moreover, a single evaluation metric has been proposed and utilized to evaluate the performances of the advanced FDD techniques. Finally, based on the papers reviewed, PV array fault management future trends and possible recommendations have been outlined.}

  abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) energy use has been increasing recently, mainly due to new policies all over the world to reduce the application of fossil fuels. PV system efficiency is highly dependent on environmental variables, besides being affected by several kinds of faults, which can lead to a severe energy loss throughout the operation of the system. In this sense, we present a Monitoring System (MS) to measure the electrical and environmental variables to produce instantaneous and historical data, allowing to estimate parameters that ar related to the plant efficiency. Additionally, using the same MS, we propose a recursive linear model to detect faults in the system, while using irradiance and temperature on the PV panel as input signals and power as output. The accuracy of the fault detection for a 5 kW power plant used in the test is 93.09\%, considering 16 days and around 143 hours of faults in different conditions. Once a fault is detected by this model, a machine-learning-based method classifies each fault in the following cases: short-circuit, open-circuit, partial shadowing, and degradation. Using the same days and faults applied in the detection module, the accuracy of the classification stage is 95.44\% for an Artificial Neural Network (ANN) model. By combining detection and classification, the overall accuracy is 92.64\%. Such a result represents an original contribution of this work, since other related works do not present the integration of a fault detection and classification approach with an embedded PV plant monitoring system, allowing for the online identification and classification of different PV faults, besides real-time and historical monitoring of electrical and environmental parameters of the plant.}

  abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) monitoring and fault detection are very crucial to enhance the service life and reliability of PV systems. It is difficult to detect and classify the faults at the Direct Current (DC) side of PV arrays by common protection devices, especially Line-to-Line (LL) faults, because such faults are not detectable under high impedance fault and low mismatch conditions. If these faults are not diagnosed, they may significantly reduce the output power of PV systems and even cause fire catastrophe. Recently, many efforts have been devoted to detecting and classifying LL faults. However, these methods could not efficiently detect and classify the LL faults under high impedance and low mismatch. This paper proposes a novel fault diagnostic scheme in accordance with the two main stages. First, the key features are extracted via analyzing Current-Voltage (I-V) characteristics under various LL fault events and normal operation. Second, a genetic algorithm (GA) is used for parameter optimization of the kernel functions used in the Support Vector Machine (SVM) classifier and feature selection in order to obtain higher performance in diagnosing the faults in PV systems. In contrast to previous studies, this method requires only a small dataset for the learning process and it has a higher accuracy in detecting and classifying the LL fault events under high impedance and low mismatch levels. The simulation results verify the validity and effectiveness of the proposed method in detecting and classifying of LL faults in PV arrays even under complex conditions. The proposed method detects and classifies the LL faults under any condition with an average accuracy of 96\% and 97.5\%, respectively.}

  abstract = {Effective fault diagnosis in a PV system requires understanding the behavior of the current/voltage (I/V) parameters in different environmental conditions. Especially during the winter season, I/V characters of certain faulty states in a PV system closely resemble that of a normal state. Therefore, a normal fault detection model can falsely predict a well-operating PV system as a faulty state and vice versa. In this paper, an intelligent fault diagnosis model is proposed for the fault detection and classification in PV systems. For the experimental verification, various fault state and normal state datasets are collected during the winter season under wide environmental conditions. The collected datasets are normalized and preprocessed using several data-mining techniques and then fed into a probabilistic neural network (PNN). The PNN model will be trained with the historical data to predict and classify faults when new data is fetched in it. The trained model showed better performance in prediction accuracy when compared with other classification methods in machine learning.}

  abstract = {Within the United States solar energy industry, there is a general motto of ``set it and forget it'' with solar energy. This notion is derived from much of the research and reliability studies around the photovoltaic (PV) panels themselves, not necessarily the PV system as a whole (including the inverter and other components). This implies that maintenance and regular monitoring is not needed. Yet many things can go wrong to cause the actual performance to deviate from the expected performance. If failures and/or unanticipated degradation issues go undetected, they will lead to reduced energy generation (and associated electricity credits) and/or potential loss of component warranty because of manufacturer turnover. Given the size of the problem and gaps with current solutions, the authors propose that PV system owners need an unbiased third-party off-the-shelf system-level predictive maintenance tool to optimize return-on-investment and minimize time to warranty claim in PV installations. This paper reviews the literature highlighting challenges, current approaches, and opportunities for PV predictive maintenance. The paper concludes with a call to action for establishing a collaborative agenda toward prioritizing PV predictive maintenance.},

The reliability of PV modules and systems is critical to the commercial success of Photovoltaic systems. The technology combines multiple components, each of which could cause a system failure or energy losses. The reliability characterization measurements of a PV power system are complicated and only a few studies succeeded to design and simulate an efficient PV system. In the current study, two relatively large-scale solar farms were designed with an output of 20 MW.

The suggested procedure consists of four main stages: (i) PV module parameters extraction, (ii) PV array simulation and experimental validation (iii) elaboration of a relevant database of both healthy and faulty operations, and (iv) network construction, training and testing. In the first stage, the unknown electrical parameters of the one diode model (ODM) are accurately identified using the best-so-far ABC algorithm. Then, based on these parameters the PV array is simulated and experimentally validated by using a PSIM™/Matlab™ co-simulation. Finally, efficient fault detection and diagnosis procedure based on PNN classifier is implemented. Four operating cases were tested in a grid connected PV system of 9.54kWp: Healthy system, three modules short-circuited in one string, ten modules short-circuited in one string, and a string disconnected from the array. Moreover, the PNN method was compared, under real operating conditions, with the feed forward back-propagation Artificial Neural Network (ANN) classifiers method, for noiseless and noisy data to evaluate the suggested method's accuracy and test its aptitude to support noisy data. The obtained results have demonstrated the high efficiency of the proposed method to detect and diagnose DC side anomalies for both noiseless and noisy data cases.}

Fault detection in such systems is imperative to improve their reliability, productivity, safety and efficiency. Here, an innovative model-based fault-detection approach for early detection of shading of PV modules and faults on the direct current (DC) side of PV systems is proposed. This approach combines the flexibility, and simplicity of a one-diode model with the extended capacity of an exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) control chart to detect incipient changes in a PV system. The one-diode model, which is easily calibrated due to its limited calibration parameters, is used to predict the healthy PV array's maximum power coordinates of current, voltage and power using measured temperatures and irradiances. Residuals, which capture the difference between the measurements and the predictions of the one-diode model, are generated and used as fault indicators. Then, the EWMA monitoring chart is applied on the uncorrelated residuals obtained from the one-diode model to detect and identify the type of fault. Actual data from the grid-connected PV system installed at the Renewable Energy Development Center, Algeria, are used to assess the performance of the proposed approach. Results show that the proposed approach successfully monitors the DC side of PV systems and detects temporary shading.}

  abstract = {The photovoltaic (PV) panel's output energy depends on many factors. As they are becoming the leading alternative energy source, it is essential to get the best out of them. Although the main factor for maximizing energy production is proportional to the amount of solar radiation reaching the photovoltaic panel surface, other factors, such as temperature and shading, influence them negatively. Moreover, being installed in a dynamic and frequently harsh environment causes a set of reasons for faults, defects, and irregular operations. Any irregular operation should be recognized and classified into faults that need attention and, therefore, maintenance or as being a regular operation due to changes in some surrounding factors, such as temperature or solar radiation. Besides, in case of faults, it would be helpful to identify the source and the cause of the problem. Hence, this study presented a novel methodology that modeled a PV system in a tree-like hierarchy, which allowed the use of a fuzzy nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) to detect and classify faults in a PV system with customizable granularity. Moreover, the used methodology enabled the identification of the exact source of fault(s) in a fully automated way. The study was done on a string of eight PV panels; however, the paper discussed using the algorithm on a more extensive PV system. The used fuzzy NARX algorithm in this study was able to classify the faults that appeared in up to five out of the eight PV panels and to identify the faulty PV panels with high accuracy. The used hardware could be controlled and monitored through a Wi-Fi connection, which added support for Internet of Things applications.}

  abstract = {Fault diagnosis in photovoltaic (PV) arrays is essential in enhancing power output as well as the useful life span of a PV system. Severe faults such as Partial Shading (PS) and high impedance faults, low location mismatch, and the presence of Maximum Power Point Tracking (MPPT) make fault detection challenging in harsh environmental conditions. In this regard, there have been several attempts made by various researchers to identify PV array faults. However, most of the previous work has focused on fault detection and classification in only a few faulty scenarios. This paper presents a novel approach that utilizes deep two-dimensional (2-D) Convolutional Neural Networks (CNN) to extract features from 2-D scalograms generated from PV system data in order to effectively detect and classify PV system faults. An in-depth quantitative evaluation of the proposed approach is presented and compared with previous classification methods for PV array faults - both classical machine learning based and deep learning based. Unlike contemporary work, five different faulty cases (including faults in PS - on which no work has been done before in the machine learning domain) have been considered in our study, along with the incorporation of MPPT. We generate a consistent dataset over which to compare ours and previous approaches, to make for the first (to the best of our knowledge) comprehensive and meaningful comparative evaluation of fault diagnosis. It is observed that the proposed method involving fine-tuned pre-trained CNN outperforms existing techniques, achieving a high fault detection accuracy of 73.53\%. Our study also highlights the importance of representative and discriminative features to classify faults (as opposed to the use of raw data), especially in the noisy scenario, where our method achieves the best performance of 70.45\%. We believe that our work will serve to guide future research in PV system fault diagnosis.}

  abstract = {This study reports the development of an innovative fault detection and diagnosis scheme to monitor the direct current (DC) side of photovoltaic (PV) systems. Towards this end, we propose a statistical approach that exploits the advantages of one-diode model and those of the univariate and multivariate exponentially weighted moving average (EWMA) charts to better detect faults. Specifically, we generate array's residuals of current, voltage and power using measured temperature and irradiance. These residuals capture the difference between the measurements and the predictions MPP for the current, voltage and power from the one-diode model, and use them as fault indicators. Then, we apply the multivariate EWMA (MEWMA) monitoring chart to the residuals to detect faults. However, a MEWMA scheme cannot identify the type of fault. Once a fault is detected in MEWMA chart, the univariate EWMA chart based on current and voltage indicators is used to identify the type of fault (e.g., short-circuit, open-circuit and shading faults). We applied this strategy to real data from the grid-connected PV system installed at the Renewable Energy Development Center, Algeria. Results show the capacity of the proposed strategy to monitors the DC side of PV systems and detects partial shading.}

  abstract = {Generally, photovoltaic (PV) fault detection approaches can be divided into two groups: end-to-end and threshold methods. The end-to-end method typically uses a deep neural network (DNN) to learn fault patterns from labeled datasets, which directly detect whether faults occur or not. The threshold method first estimates power generation and uses thresholds to detect atypical deviations of measured values from estimated ones. The former method heavily relies on fault-labeled data and, therefore, requires the collection of abnormal event records, which is usually difficult, due to the sparseness of these events. The latter method typically uses statistical approaches, such as 3-sigma, to find thresholds, and it can be practically utilized without fault labels. However, setting a threshold with a proper confidence interval is still challenging, as PV power generation is sensitive to variations in environmental conditions, such as irradiance, ambient temperature, wind speed and humidity. In this paper, we propose a novel deep reinforcement learning (DRL)-based label-free fault detection scheme in which thresholds are dynamically assigned with suitable confidence intervals under varying environmental conditions. Various weather properties were used as input features (i.e., states) to a DRL agent, and proper thresholds were estimated in real time from the actions of the DRL agent. To this end, a reward function was designed for learning proper thresholds without fault labels under different weather conditions. To evaluate the performance of the proposed scheme, the PV dataset of the National Institute of Standards and Technology (NIST) was used, as it includes paired records of local weather and PV generations. The DRL-based scheme was compared with static and conventional dynamic threshold methods, based on statistical approaches. The results revealed that the proposed scheme outperformed the existing methods, providing a 5.67\% higher F1-score in the NIST dataset.},

  abstract = {Over the past few years, there has been a significant increase in the interest in and adoption of solar energy all over the world. However, despite ongoing efforts to protect photovoltaic (PV) plants, they are continuously exposed to numerous anomalies. If not detected accurately and in a timely manner, anomalies in PV plants may degrade the desired performance and result in severe consequences. Hence, developing effective and flexible methods capable of early detection of anomalies in PV plants is essential for enhancing their management. This paper proposes flexible data-driven techniques to accurately detect anomalies in the DC side of the PV plants. Essentially, this approach amalgamates the desirable characteristics of ensemble learning approaches (i.e., the boosting (BS) and bagging (BG)) and the sensitivity of the Double Exponentially Weighted Moving Average (DEWMA) chart. Here, we employ ensemble learning techniques to exploit their capability to enhance the modeling accuracy and the sensitivity of the DEWMA monitoring chart to uncover potential anomalies. In the ensemble models, the values of parameters are selected with the assistance of the Bayesian optimization algorithm. Here, BS and BG are adopted to obtain residuals, which are then monitored by the DEWMA chart. Kernel density estimation is utilized to define the decision thresholds of the proposed ensemble learning-based charts. The proposed monitoring schemes are illustrated via actual measurements from a 9.54 kW PV plant. Results showed the superior detection performance of the BS and BG-based DEWMA charts with non-parametric threshold in uncovering different types of anomalies, including circuit breaker faults, inverter disconnections, and short-circuit faults. In addition, the performance of the proposed schemes is compared to that of BG and BS-based DEWMA and EWMA charts with parametric thresholds.},

  abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) fault detection is crucial because undetected PV faults can lead to significant energy losses, with some cases experiencing losses of up to 10\%. The efficiency of PV systems depends upon the reliable detection and diagnosis of faults. The integration of Artificial Intelligence (AI) techniques has been a growing trend in addressing these issues. The goal of this systematic review is to offer a comprehensive overview of the recent advancements in AI-based methodologies for PV fault detection, consolidating the key findings from 31 research papers. An initial pool of 142 papers were identified, from which 31 were selected for in-depth review following the PRISMA guidelines. The title, objective, methods, and findings of each paper were analyzed, with a focus on machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) approaches. ML and DL are particularly suitable for PV fault detection because of their capacity to process and analyze large amounts of data to identify complex patterns and anomalies. This study identified several AI techniques used for fault detection in PV systems, ranging from classical ML methods like k-nearest neighbor (KNN) and random forest to more advanced deep learning models such as Convolutional Neural Networks (CNNs). Quantum circuits and infrared imagery were also explored as potential solutions. The analysis found that DL models, in general, outperformed traditional ML models in accuracy and efficiency. This study shows that AI methodologies have evolved and been increasingly applied in PV fault detection. The integration of AI in PV fault detection offers high accuracy and effectiveness. After reviewing these studies, we proposed an Artificial Neural Network (ANN)-based method for PV fault detection and classification.},

More specifically, we demonstrate that a little-known area of semi-supervised machine learning called positive unlabeled learning can effectively learn solar fault detection models using only a fraction of the labeled data required by traditional techniques. We further introduce a new feedback enhanced positive unlabeled learning algorithm that can increase model accuracy and performance in situations such as solar fault detection when few sensor features are available. Using these algorithms, we create a positive unlabeled solar fault detection model that can match and even exceed the performance of a fully supervised fault classifier using only 5\% of the total labeled data.},

For future energy demands, it is critical to progress toward a dependable, cost-effective, and sustainable renewable energy source. Solar energy, along with all other alternative energy sources, is a potential renewable resource to manage these enduring challenges in the energy crisis. Solar power generation is expanding globally as a result of growing energy demands and depleting fossil fuel reserves, which are presently the primary sources of power generation. In the realm of solar power generation, photovoltaic (PV) panels are used to convert solar radiation into energy. They are subjected to the constantly changing state of the environment, resulting in a wide range of defects. These defects should be discovered and remedied as soon as possible so that PV panels efficiency, endurance, and durability are not compromised. This paper focuses on five aspects, namely, (i) the various possible faults that occur in PV panels, (ii) the online/remote supervision of PV panels, (iii) the role of machine learning techniques in the fault diagnosis of PV panels, (iv) the various sensors used for different fault detections in PV panels, and (v) the benefits of fault identification in PV panels.

Furthermore, a third order polynomial function is used to generate two detection limits for the VR and PR ratios obtained using VI LabVIEW simulation tool.

Samples lie out of the detection limits are processed by a fuzzy logic classification system which consists of two inputs and one output membership function.  In this paper, PV faults corresponds to a short circuited PV module. The obtained results show that the fault detection algorithm can accurately detect different faults occurring in the PV system, where the maximum detection accuracy of before considering the fuzzy logic system is equal to 95.27\%. However, the fault detection accuracy is increased up to a minimum value of 98.8\% after considering the fuzzy system.}

  abstract = {Abstract   This work proposes a new fault detection algorithm for photovoltaic (PV) systems based on artificial neural networks (ANN) and fuzzy logic system interface. There are few instances of machine learning techniques deployed in fault detection algorithms in PV systems, therefore, the main focus of this paper is to create a system capable to detect possible faults in PV systems using radial basis function (RBF) ANN network and both Mamdani, Sugeno fuzzy logic systems interface.  The obtained results indicate that the fault detection algorithm can detect and locate accurately different types of faults such as, faulty PV module, two faulty PV modules and partial shading conditions affecting the PV system. In order to achieve high rate of detection accuracy, four various ANN networks have been tested. The maximum detection accuracy is equal to 92.1\%. Furthermore, both examined fuzzy logic systems show approximately the same output during the experiments. However, there are slightly difference in developing each type of the fuzzy systems such as the output membership functions and the rules applied for detecting the type of the fault occurring in the PV plant.}

  abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) systems are subject to failures during their operation due to the aging effects and external/environmental conditions. These faults may affect the different system components such as PV modules, connection lines, converters/inverters, which can lead to a decrease in the efficiency, performance, and further system collapse. Thus, a key factor to be taken into consideration in high-efficiency grid-connected PV systems is the fault detection and diagnosis (FDD). The performance of the FDD method depends mainly on the quality of the extracted features including real-time changes, phase changes, trend changes, and faulty modes. Thus, the data representation learning is the core stage of intelligent FDD techniques. Recently, due to the enhancement of computing capabilities, the increase of the big data use, and the development of effective algorithms, the deep learning (DL) tool has witnessed a great success in data science. Therefore, this paper proposes an extensive review on deep learning based FDD methods for PV systems. After a brief description of the DL-based strategies, techniques for diagnosing PV systems proposed in recent literature are overviewed and analyzed to point out their differences, advantages and limits. Future research directions towards the improvement of the performance of the DL-based FDD techniques are also discussed. This review paper aims to systematically present the development of DL-based FDD for PV systems and provide guidelines for future research in the field.}

First, a supervised machine learning (neural network) was developed for the fault detection process based on the estimated output power. Second, an extra tree supervised algorithm was used for extracting important features from a current-voltage (I-V) curve. Third, a multi-stacking-based ensemble learning algorithm was developed to effectively classify faults in solar panels. In this work, single faults and multiple faults are investigated. The benefit of the stacking strategy is that it can combine the strengths of several machine learning-based algorithms that are known to deliver good results on classification tasks, producing results that are more precise and efficient than those produced by a single algorithm. The approach was tested using an experimental dataset and the findings show that it could accurately diagnose faults (a detection rate of around 98.56\% and a classification rate of around 96.21\%). A comparison study with different ensemble learning algorithms (AdaBoost, CatBoost, and XGBoost) was conducted to evaluate the effectiveness of the suggested method.},

Two approaches have emerged to tackle this problem: unsupervised and supervised. Supervised approaches require a sufficient amount of labeled data and are challenged by novel types of outliers and inherent class imbalance, whereas unsupervised methods do not take advantage of available labeled training examples and often exhibit poorer predictive performance. We propose BORE (a Bagged Outlier Representation Ensemble) which uses unsupervised outlier scoring functions (OSFs) as features in a supervised learning framework. BORE is able to adapt to arbitrary OSF feature representations, to the imbalance in labeled data as well as to prediction-time constraints on computational cost. We demonstrate the good performance of BORE compared to a variety of competing methods in the non-budgeted and the budgeted outlier detection problem on 12 real-world datasets.},

  abstract = {Effective fault detection and classification play essential roles in reducing the hazards such as electric shocks and fire in photovoltaic (PV) systems. However, the issues of interest in fault detection and classification for PV systems remain an open-ended challenge due to manual and time-consuming processes that require the relevant domain knowledge and experience of fault diagnoses. This paper proposes a hybrid deep-learning (DL) model-based combined architectures as the novel DL approaches to achieve the real-time automatic fault detection and classification of a PV system. This research employed the wavelet packet transform (WPT) as a data preprocessing technique to handle the PV voltage signal collected and feeding them as the inputs for combined DL architectures that consist of the equilibrium optimizer algorithm (EOA) and long short-term memory (LSTM-SAE) approaches. The combined DL architectures are able to extract the fault features automatically from the preprocessed data without requiring any previous knowledge, therefore can override the traditional shortages of manual feature extraction and manual selection of optimal features from the extracted fault features. These desirable features are anticipated to speed up the fault detection and classification capability of the proposed DL model with higher accuracy. In order to determine the performance of the proposed fault model, we carried out a comprehensive evaluation study on a 250-kW grid-connected PV system. In this paper, symmetrical and asymmetrical faults have been studied involving all the phases and ground faults such as single phase to ground, phases to phase, phase to phase to ground, and three-phase to ground. The simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed model in terms of computation time, accuracy of fault detection, and noise robustness. Comprehensive comparisons between the simulation results and previous studies demonstrate the multidisciplinary applications of the present study.},

To achieve the best-fit ML structure, three distinct ML classifiers are compared, namely, Decision Tree (DT) based on different splitting criteria, K-Nearest Neighbors (KNN) based on the different metrics of distance and weighting functions, and Support Vector Machine (SVM) based on different Kernel functions and multi-classification approaches.

Whilst the most common technology today is mono- and multi-crystalline silicon, this article aims to give a generic summary which is relevant for a wider range of photovoltaic technologies including cadmium telluride, copper indium gallium selenide and emerging low-cost high-efficiency technologies.

Secondly, a summary of the main stress factors and how they influence module degradation. Finally, a detailed review of degradation and failure modes, which has been partitioned by the individual component within a PV module. This section connects the degradation phenomena and failure modes to the module component, and its effects on the PV system. Building on this knowledge, strategies to improve the operational lifetime of PV systems and thus, to reduce the electricity cost can be devised.

In this paper, to evaluate the performance of ML models that are suitable for embedding in low-cost hardware at the module level, eight different PV module faults and their impacts on PV module output are discussed based on a literature review and simulation. The faults are emulated and applied to a real PV system, allowing the collection and labelling of panel-level measurement data.

The novel part of this research is the successful development, deployment and validation of a fault detection PV system using radial basis function (RBF), requiring only two parameters as the input to the ANN (solar irradiance and output power). The results obtained through the testing of the developed ANN on a PV installation of 2.2kW capacity, provided an accuracy of 97.9\%. To endorse the accuracy of the newly developed algorithm, the ANN was tested on another PV system, installed at a remote location. The total capacity of the new system was significantly higher, 4.16kW. A vital part of the test was to see how the proposed ANN would perform with `scaled-up' input data, during normal operation as well as partial shading scenarios. The validation process provided an overall fault detection accuracy of above 97\%. The decrease in accuracy was due to the varying nature of the two systems in terms of total capacity, number of samples and type of faults.},

However, installation of PV systems is prone to faults that can occur unpredictably and remain challenging to detect. Major PV faults that can occur are line-line and open circuits faults, and if they are not addressed appropriately and timely, they may lead to serious problems in the PV system. To solve this problem, this study proposes a voting-based ensemble learning algorithm with linear regression, decision tree, and support vector machine (EL-VLR-DT-SVM) for PV fault detection and diagnosis. The data acquisition is performed for different weather conditions to trigger the nonlinear nature of the PV system characteristics. The voltage-current characteristics are used as input data. The dataset is studied for a deeper understanding, and pre-processing before feeding it to the EL-VLR-DT-SVM. In the pre-processing step, data are normalized to obtain more feature space, making it easy for the proposed algorithm to discriminate between healthy and faulty conditions. To verify the proposed method, it is compared with other algorithms in terms of accuracy, precision, recall, and F-1 score. The results show that the proposed EL-VLR-DT-SVM algorithm outperforms the other algorithms.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an eXplainable Fault Detection and Diagnosis System (XFDDS) for incipient faults in PV panels. The XFDDS is a hybrid approach that combines the model-based and data-driven framework. Model-based FDD for PV panels lacks high fidelity models at low irradiance conditions for detecting incipient faults. To overcome this, a novel irradiance based three diode model (IB3DM) is proposed. It is a nine parameter model that provides higher accuracy even at low irradiance conditions, an important aspect for detecting incipient faults from noise. To exploit PV data, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is used due to its ability to detecting incipient faults. Lack of explainability, feature variability for sample instances, and false alarms are challenges with data-driven FDD methods. These shortcomings are overcome by hybridization of XGBoost and IB3DM, and using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques. To combine the XGBoost and IB3DM, a fault-signature metric is proposed that helps reducing false alarms and also trigger an explanation on detecting incipient faults. To provide explainability, an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) application is developed. It uses the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) framework and provides explanations on classifier outputs for data instances. These explanations help field engineers/technicians for performing troubleshooting and maintenance operations. The proposed XFDDS is illustrated using experiments on different PV technologies and our results demonstrate the perceived benefits.},

"EXPONENTIAL growth in photovoltaic (PV) deployments panels are installed in harsh environments and subjected to varying weather conditions, they are prone to diverse faults (permanent, incipient, and intermittent) with different severity levels [2]. Such faults could diminish energy production, accelerate aging, and even cause fire hazards [3]. Therefore, detecting and locating faults early (at the incipient stage) is pivotal for the PV panel's reliable operations [4]." (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GSXCWBT8?page=1}{Sairam et al 2020:1})

"faults could develop as a severe fault in the long-run if left undetected/unattended, leading to costly replacements and maintenance operations [5" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GSXCWBT8?page=1}{Sairam et al 2020:1})

"in IB3DM, the ideality factors are not fixed; rather, they are obtained as a solution to an optimization problem by specifying bounds ([0, 2]). This is a deviation from existing works in three diode models where higher ideality factors are used leading to low fill-factor that could be achieved only in industrial-grade panels. This makes existing TDM unsuitable for residential PV panels" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GSXCWBT8?page=2}{Sairam et al 2020:2})

"To provide local explanations and address challenges (C2)- (C4), the data-driven approach is first fused with model-based approach by proposing a fault-signature metric (FSM) given by, (G; P ) =  (G) exp  kG  G s k ' 2  G  1 exp  kP  {\textasciicircum} P k ' 2  P  1 ;p (11" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GSXCWBT8?page=4}{Sairam et al 2020:4})

"LIME) [27] framework. It utilizes surrogate modelling wherein the model is considered a black-box, and the features are perturbed to find feature importance on a particular sample" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GSXCWBT8?page=4}{Sairam et al 2020:4})
\par
"While the core of XFDS is still the XGBoost, the XAI extracts explanations on why a particular sample was classified as being faulty/healthy. Further, thresholds on variables that helped make these decisions are also provided, which is quite useful in detecting even the fault type. For example, a LL fault is characterized by high voltage but a lower current and power. As power drops due to circulating currents are very hard to predict. Moreover, intermittent LL faults are difficult to catch FDDS. However, with XAI could reason out incipient LL faults" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GSXCWBT8?page=4}{Sairam et al 2020:4})
\par
"Explanations on a sample which was false positive detected by XGBoost and explanations provided by the XAI is shown in Fig.13. Here the decision was based on the current value, which was less than 7.84 A . However, the power level greater than 1112.89 W shows that this is not a fault. This way, false positives could be avoided by explanations, and this denotes an intermittent behaviour of the load to the field engineer" (\href{zotero://open-pdf/library/items/GSXCWBT8?page=7}{Sairam et al 2020:7})},

  abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) system energy production is non-linear because it is influenced by the random nature of weather conditions. The use of machine learning techniques to model the PV system energy production is recommended since there is no known way to deal well with non-linear data. In order to detect PV system faults, the machine learning models should provide accurate outputs. The aim of this work is to accurately predict the DC energy of six PV strings of a utility-scale PV system and to accurately detect PV string faults by benchmarking the results of four machine learning methodologies known to improve the accuracy of the machine learning models, such as the data mining methodology, machine learning technique benchmarking methodology, hybrid methodology, and the ensemble methodology. A new hybrid methodology is proposed in this work which combines the use of a fuzzy system and the use of a machine learning system containing five different trained machine learning models, such as the regression tree, artificial neural networks, multi-gene genetic programming, Gaussian process, and support vector machines for regression. The results showed that the hybrid methodology provided the most accurate machine learning predictions of the PV string DC energy, and consequently the PV string fault detection is successful.}

  abstract = {With the rapid development of solar energy, the photovoltaic (PV) module fault detection plays an important role in knowing how to enhance the reliability of the solar photovoltaic system and knowing the fault type when a system problem occurs. Therefore, this paper proposed the hybrid algorithm of chaos synchronization detection method (CSDM) with convolutional neural network (CNN) for studying PV module fault detection. Four common PV module states were discussed, including the normal PV module, module breakage, module contact defectiveness and module bypass diode failure. First of all, the defects in 16 pieces of 20W monocrystalline silicon PV modules were preprocessed, and there were four pieces of each fault state. When the signal generator delivered high frequency voltage to the PV module, the original signal was measured and captured by the NI PXI-5105 high-speed data acquisition system (DAS) and was calculated by CSDM, to establish the chaos dynamic error map as the image feature of fault diagnosis. Finally, the CNN was employed for diagnosing the fault state of the PV module. The findings show that after entering 400 random fault data (100 data for each fault) into the proposed method for recognition, the recognition accuracy rate of the proposed method was as high as 99.5\%, which is better than the traditional ENN algorithm that had a recognition rate of 86.75\%. In addition, the advantage of the proposed algorithm is that the mass original measured data can be reduced by CSDM, the subtle changes in the output signals are captured effectively and displayed in images, and the PV module fault state is accurately recognized by CNN.}

  abstract = {The output generated by photovoltaic arrays is influenced mainly by the irradiance, which has non-uniform distribution in a day. This has resulted in the current-limiting nature and nonlinear output characteristics, and conventional protection devices cannot detect and clean faults appropriately. This paper proposes a low-cost model for a multi-scale dual-stage photovoltaic fault detection, classification, and monitoring technique developed through MATLAB/Simulink. The main contribution of this paper is that it can detect multiple common faults, be applied on multi-scale photovoltaic arrays regardless of environmental conditions, and be beneficial for photovoltaic system maintenance work. The experimental results show that the developed algorithm using supervised learning algorithms mutual with k-fold cross-validation has produced good performances in identifying six common faults of photovoltaic arrays, achieved 100\% accuracy in fault detection, and achieved good accuracy in fault classification. Challenges and suggestions for future research direction are also suggested in this paper. Overall, this study shall provide researchers and policymakers with a valuable reference for developing photovoltaic system fault detection and monitoring techniques for better feasibility, safety, and energy sustainability.},

  abstract = {Abstract   Health monitoring and diagnosis of photovoltaic (PV) systems is becoming crucial to maximise the power production, increase the reliability and life service of PV power plants. Operating under faulty conditions, in particular under shading, PV plants have remarkable shape of current-voltage (I-V) characteristics in comparison to reference condition (healthy operation). Based on real electrical measurements (I-V), the present work aims to provide a very simple, robust and low cost Fault Detection and Classification (FDC) method for PV shading faults. At first, we extract the features for different experimental tests under healthy and shading conditions to build the database. The features are then analysed using Principal Component Analysis (PCA). The accuracy of the data classification into the PCA space is evaluated using the confusion matrix as a metric of class separability. The results using experimental data of a 250 Wp PV module are very promising with a successful classification rate higher than 97\% with four different configurations. The method is also cost effective as it uses only electrical measurements that are already available. No additional sensors are required.}

  abstract = {The global shift towards sustainable energy has positioned photovoltaic (PV) systems as a critical component in the renewable energy landscape. However, maintaining the efficiency and longevity of these systems requires effective fault detection and diagnosis mechanisms. Traditional methods, relying on manual inspections and standard electrical measurements, have proven inadequate, especially for large-scale solar installations. The emergence of machine learning (ML) and deep learning (DL) has sparked significant interest in developing computational strategies to enhance the identification and classification of PV system faults. Despite these advancements, challenges remain, particularly due to the limited availability of public datasets for PV fault detection and the complexity of existing artificial-intelligence (AI)-based methods. This study distinguishes itself by proposing a novel AI-based approach that optimizes fault detection and classification in PV systems, addressing existing gaps in AI-driven fault detection, especially in terms of thermal imaging and current--voltage (I-V) curve analysis. This comprehensive survey identifies emerging trends in AI-driven PV fault detection, highlights the most advanced methodologies, and proposes a novel AI-based approach to enhance fault detection and classification capabilities. The findings aim to advance the state of technology in this field, offering insights into more efficient and practical solutions for PV system fault management.},

  abstract = {The utilization of solar energy by photovoltaic (PV) systems has received much research and development attention across the globe. In the past decades, a large number of PV array have been installed. Since the installed PV arrays often operate in harsh environments, nonuniform aging can occur and impact adversely on the performance of PV systems, especially in the middle and late periods of their service life. Due to the high cost of replacing aged PV modules by new modules, it is appealing to improve energy efficiency of aged PV systems. For this purpose, this paper presents a PV module reconfiguration strategy to achieve the maximum power generation from nonuniformly aged PV arrays without significant investment. The proposed reconfiguration strategy is based on the cell-unit structure of PV modules, the operating voltage limit of grid-connected converter, and the resulted bucket effect of the maximum short-circuit current. The objectives are to analyze all the potential reorganization options of the PV modules, find the maximum power point, and express it in a proposition. This proposition is further developed into a novel implementable algorithm to calculate the maximum power generation and the corresponding reconfiguration of the PV modules. The immediate benefits from this reconfiguration are the increased total power output and maximum power point voltage information for global maximum power point tracking. A PV array simulation model is used to illustrate the proposed method under three different cases. Furthermore, an experimental rig is built to verify the effectiveness of the proposed method. The proposed method will open an effective approach for condition-based maintenance of emerging aging PV arrays.}

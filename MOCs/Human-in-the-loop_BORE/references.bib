  abstract = {The degradation of photovoltaic (PV) systems is one of the key factors to address in order to reduce the cost of the electricity produced by increasing the operational lifetime of PV systems. To reduce the degradation, it is imperative to know the degradation and failure phenomena. This review article has been prepared to present an overview of the state-of-the-art knowledge on the reliability of PV modules. Whilst the most common technology today is mono- and multi-crystalline silicon, this article aims to give a generic summary which is relevant for a wider range of photovoltaic technologies including cadmium telluride, copper indium gallium selenide and emerging low-cost high-efficiency technologies. The review consists of three parts: firstly, a brief contextual summary about reliability metrics and how reliability is measured. Secondly, a summary of the main stress factors and how they influence module degradation. Finally, a detailed review of degradation and failure modes, which has been partitioned by the individual component within a PV module. This section connects the degradation phenomena and failure modes to the module component, and its effects on the PV system. Building on this knowledge, strategies to improve the operational lifetime of PV systems and thus, to reduce the electricity cost can be devised. Through extensive testing and failure analysis, researchers now have a much better overview of stressors and their impact on long term stability.},

  abstract = {Within the United States solar energy industry, there is a general motto of ``set it and forget it'' with solar energy. This notion is derived from much of the research and reliability studies around the photovoltaic (PV) panels themselves, not necessarily the PV system as a whole (including the inverter and other components). This implies that maintenance and regular monitoring is not needed. Yet many things can go wrong to cause the actual performance to deviate from the expected performance. If failures and/or unanticipated degradation issues go undetected, they will lead to reduced energy generation (and associated electricity credits) and/or potential loss of component warranty because of manufacturer turnover. Given the size of the problem and gaps with current solutions, the authors propose that PV system owners need an unbiased third-party off-the-shelf system-level predictive maintenance tool to optimize return-on-investment and minimize time to warranty claim in PV installations. This paper reviews the literature highlighting challenges, current approaches, and opportunities for PV predictive maintenance. The paper concludes with a call to action for establishing a collaborative agenda toward prioritizing PV predictive maintenance.},

A possible energy source is clean solar energy. The most common technology used is a silicon semiconductor device, which generates electrical output while interacting with light, known as Photo-Voltaic (PV) System. The reliability of PV modules and systems is critical to the commercial success of Photovoltaic systems. The technology combines multiple components, each of which could cause a system failure or energy losses. The reliability characterization measurements of a PV power system are complicated and only a few studies succeeded to design and simulate an efficient PV system. In the current study, two relatively large-scale solar farms were designed with an output of 20 MW. A comparison of the solar farms' performances was conducted, with an emphasis on the reliability indices of the systems. The obtained reliability indices are 83\% and 88\% for the studied solar farms.},

  abstract = {The photovoltaic (PV) panel's output energy depends on many factors. As they are becoming the leading alternative energy source, it is essential to get the best out of them. Although the main factor for maximizing energy production is proportional to the amount of solar radiation reaching the photovoltaic panel surface, other factors, such as temperature and shading, influence them negatively. Moreover, being installed in a dynamic and frequently harsh environment causes a set of reasons for faults, defects, and irregular operations. Any irregular operation should be recognized and classified into faults that need attention and, therefore, maintenance or as being a regular operation due to changes in some surrounding factors, such as temperature or solar radiation. Besides, in case of faults, it would be helpful to identify the source and the cause of the problem. Hence, this study presented a novel methodology that modeled a PV system in a tree-like hierarchy, which allowed the use of a fuzzy nonlinear autoregressive network with exogenous inputs (NARX) to detect and classify faults in a PV system with customizable granularity. Moreover, the used methodology enabled the identification of the exact source of fault(s) in a fully automated way. The study was done on a string of eight PV panels; however, the paper discussed using the algorithm on a more extensive PV system. The used fuzzy NARX algorithm in this study was able to classify the faults that appeared in up to five out of the eight PV panels and to identify the faulty PV panels with high accuracy. The used hardware could be controlled and monitored through a Wi-Fi connection, which added support for Internet of Things applications.}

This paper improves of the categorization of methods to study the faulty PVS by considering visual and thermal method and electrical based method. Moreover, an effort is made to list all potential faults in a PVS in both the DC and AC sides. Specific PV fault detection and classification techniques are also enumerated.

  abstract = {Faults detection and analysis in PV system are considered critical for ensuring safety and increasing output power of PV arrays. PV faults do not only reduce output power and efficiency but also lessen the working life time of a system. Most common and chronic PV faults are line to line, line to ground, shadowing fault, and arc fault while less common and acute faults are hotspot, degradation, bypass diode, and connection faults. Event of PV fault detection failures, such as most recent in Mount Holly, USA in 2011 evinced the improvement in current fault detection and mitigation techniques to shrink such failures. There are various limitations in the existing fault detection techniques, as identified in this paper, which may cause misdetection of the faults. This paper is focused on mathematical formulation of various PV faults and lead to the latter's critical analysis in terms of efficiency, accuracy, complexity, and reliability. The presented work also helps to identify nature and causes of occurrence of a PV fault. This research work serves as a special set of references and recommendations for researchers and PV manufacturing industry to improve fault detection prospects in solar PV systems.},

  abstract = {Photovoltaic (PV) systems are subject to failures during their operation due to the aging effects and external/environmental conditions. These faults may affect the different system components such as PV modules, connection lines, converters/inverters, which can lead to a decrease in the efficiency, performance, and further system collapse. Thus, a key factor to be taken into consideration in high-efficiency grid-connected PV systems is the fault detection and diagnosis (FDD). The performance of the FDD method depends mainly on the quality of the extracted features including real-time changes, phase changes, trend changes, and faulty modes. Thus, the data representation learning is the core stage of intelligent FDD techniques. Recently, due to the enhancement of computing capabilities, the increase of the big data use, and the development of effective algorithms, the deep learning (DL) tool has witnessed a great success in data science. Therefore, this paper proposes an extensive review on deep learning based FDD methods for PV systems. After a brief description of the DL-based strategies, techniques for diagnosing PV systems proposed in recent literature are overviewed and analyzed to point out their differences, advantages and limits. Future research directions towards the improvement of the performance of the DL-based FDD techniques are also discussed. This review paper aims to systematically present the development of DL-based FDD for PV systems and provide guidelines for future research in the field.}

Two approaches have emerged to tackle this problem: unsupervised and supervised. Supervised approaches require a sufficient amount of labeled data and are challenged by novel types of outliers and inherent class imbalance, whereas unsupervised methods do not take advantage of available labeled training examples and often exhibit poorer predictive performance. We propose BORE (a Bagged Outlier Representation Ensemble) which uses unsupervised outlier scoring functions (OSFs) as features in a supervised learning framework. BORE is able to adapt to arbitrary OSF feature representations, to the imbalance in labeled data as well as to prediction-time constraints on computational cost. We demonstrate the good performance of BORE compared to a variety of competing methods in the non-budgeted and the budgeted outlier detection problem on 12 real-world datasets.},

  abstract = {Effective fault detection and classification play essential roles in reducing the hazards such as electric shocks and fire in photovoltaic (PV) systems. However, the issues of interest in fault detection and classification for PV systems remain an open-ended challenge due to manual and time-consuming processes that require the relevant domain knowledge and experience of fault diagnoses. This paper proposes a hybrid deep-learning (DL) model-based combined architectures as the novel DL approaches to achieve the real-time automatic fault detection and classification of a PV system. This research employed the wavelet packet transform (WPT) as a data preprocessing technique to handle the PV voltage signal collected and feeding them as the inputs for combined DL architectures that consist of the equilibrium optimizer algorithm (EOA) and long short-term memory (LSTM-SAE) approaches. The combined DL architectures are able to extract the fault features automatically from the preprocessed data without requiring any previous knowledge, therefore can override the traditional shortages of manual feature extraction and manual selection of optimal features from the extracted fault features. These desirable features are anticipated to speed up the fault detection and classification capability of the proposed DL model with higher accuracy. In order to determine the performance of the proposed fault model, we carried out a comprehensive evaluation study on a 250-kW grid-connected PV system. In this paper, symmetrical and asymmetrical faults have been studied involving all the phases and ground faults such as single phase to ground, phases to phase, phase to phase to ground, and three-phase to ground. The simulation results validate the efficacy of the proposed model in terms of computation time, accuracy of fault detection, and noise robustness. Comprehensive comparisons between the simulation results and previous studies demonstrate the multidisciplinary applications of the present study.},

  abstract = {Abstract   In this paper, a fault detection algorithm for photovoltaic systems based on artificial neural networks (ANN) is proposed. Numerous literatures can be found on the topic of PV fault detection through the implementation of artificial intelligence. The novel part of this research is the successful development, deployment and validation of a fault detection PV system using radial basis function (RBF), requiring only two parameters as the input to the ANN (solar irradiance and output power). The results obtained through the testing of the developed ANN on a PV installation of 2.2kW capacity, provided an accuracy of 97.9\%. To endorse the accuracy of the newly developed algorithm, the ANN was tested on another PV system, installed at a remote location. The total capacity of the new system was significantly higher, 4.16kW. A vital part of the test was to see how the proposed ANN would perform with `scaled-up' input data, during normal operation as well as partial shading scenarios. The validation process provided an overall fault detection accuracy of above 97\%. The decrease in accuracy was due to the varying nature of the two systems in terms of total capacity, number of samples and type of faults.},

  abstract = {This paper presents an eXplainable Fault Detection and Diagnosis System (XFDDS) for incipient faults in PV panels. The XFDDS is a hybrid approach that combines the model-based and data-driven framework. Model-based FDD for PV panels lacks high fidelity models at low irradiance conditions for detecting incipient faults. To overcome this, a novel irradiance based three diode model (IB3DM) is proposed. It is a nine parameter model that provides higher accuracy even at low irradiance conditions, an important aspect for detecting incipient faults from noise. To exploit PV data, extreme gradient boosting (XGBoost) is used due to its ability to detecting incipient faults. Lack of explainability, feature variability for sample instances, and false alarms are challenges with data-driven FDD methods. These shortcomings are overcome by hybridization of XGBoost and IB3DM, and using eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) techniques. To combine the XGBoost and IB3DM, a fault-signature metric is proposed that helps reducing false alarms and also trigger an explanation on detecting incipient faults. To provide explainability, an eXplainable Artificial Intelligence (XAI) application is developed. It uses the local interpretable model-agnostic explanations (LIME) framework and provides explanations on classifier outputs for data instances. These explanations help field engineers/technicians for performing troubleshooting and maintenance operations. The proposed XFDDS is illustrated using experiments on different PV technologies and our results demonstrate the perceived benefits.},

  abstract = {With the rapid development of solar energy, the photovoltaic (PV) module fault detection plays an important role in knowing how to enhance the reliability of the solar photovoltaic system and knowing the fault type when a system problem occurs. Therefore, this paper proposed the hybrid algorithm of chaos synchronization detection method (CSDM) with convolutional neural network (CNN) for studying PV module fault detection. Four common PV module states were discussed, including the normal PV module, module breakage, module contact defectiveness and module bypass diode failure. First of all, the defects in 16 pieces of 20W monocrystalline silicon PV modules were preprocessed, and there were four pieces of each fault state. When the signal generator delivered high frequency voltage to the PV module, the original signal was measured and captured by the NI PXI-5105 high-speed data acquisition system (DAS) and was calculated by CSDM, to establish the chaos dynamic error map as the image feature of fault diagnosis. Finally, the CNN was employed for diagnosing the fault state of the PV module. The findings show that after entering 400 random fault data (100 data for each fault) into the proposed method for recognition, the recognition accuracy rate of the proposed method was as high as 99.5\%, which is better than the traditional ENN algorithm that had a recognition rate of 86.75\%. In addition, the advantage of the proposed algorithm is that the mass original measured data can be reduced by CSDM, the subtle changes in the output signals are captured effectively and displayed in images, and the PV module fault state is accurately recognized by CNN.}

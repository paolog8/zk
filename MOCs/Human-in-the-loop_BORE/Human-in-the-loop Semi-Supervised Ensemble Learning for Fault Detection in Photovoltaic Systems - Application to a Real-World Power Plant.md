# Introduction
## 3. The Gap & The Need for Hybrid Approaches
- **Identifying the Research Gap:**
    - Need for methods bridging Data Scarcity and demand for Actionable Fault Diagnostics.
        - ### 4c1a13 - Hybrid ML Models Address Data Scarcity and Actionability in PV Fault Detection

          Hybrid machine learning (ML) models are a pivotal strategy for improving fault detection in photovoltaic (PV) systems.
          They are necessary to overcome two key challenges: the scarcity of labeled fault data and the need for diagnostic results that are actionable for maintenance teams.

          By combining different techniques, such as deep learning for feature extraction and traditional ML for classification, these models can enhance diagnostic accuracy and robustness.
          This approach creates more reliable and effective fault detection systems that are not solely dependent on massive, often unavailable, labeled datasets.
- **Introduction to Semi-Supervised Learning:**
    - Leveraging Unlabeled Data (abundance) and Limited Labeled Data (specificity).
	    - ### 4c1a8g - Scarce Labeled Data Drives Adoption of Hybrid Learning in PV Fault Detection
	      A primary challenge in developing machine learning models for photovoltaic (PV) fault detection is the scarcity of labeled fault data. 
	      This limitation has spurred a shift towards hybrid and semi-supervised learning techniques that leverage the vast amounts of available unlabeled data alongside the limited labeled samples (Jaskie et al., 2021; Et-taleby et al., 2023).
	      
	      Faults from shading, soiling, or damage can reduce PV energy production by over 27% (Jaskie et al., 2021). 
	      Traditional supervised models struggle because real-world PV arrays have few faulty instances for training. 
	      Hybrid methods overcome this by combining supervised and unsupervised paradigms, creating a more nuanced and effective framework for fault diagnosis.
        - ### 4c1a8j - Semi-Supervised Learning Improves Accuracy by Generalizing from Unlabeled Data (Wang et al. 2023, Dai et al. 2021, Ghazali & Sujod 2022)

          Semi-supervised learning is particularly effective for PV fault detection because it is designed to learn from datasets containing a small number of labeled examples and a large number of unlabeled examples.
          This mirrors the typical data environment of real-world PV systems (Wang et al., 2023; Dai et al., 2021).

          The methodology allows a model to first gain structured insights from the few labeled instances.
          It then iteratively refines and improves its accuracy by generalizing patterns from the vast pool of unlabeled data.
          This multi-stage learning process enables higher performance and more robust fault classification than relying on limited labeled data alone (Ghazali & Sujod, 2022).
        - ### 4c1a8k - Semi-Supervised Learning Reduces Labeled Data Dependency in PV Fault Detection (Zhang et al. 2024, Ghazali & Sujod 2022)

          To overcome the limitations of purely supervised methods, there is a significant shift towards semi-supervised and unsupervised learning for PV fault detection.
          These approaches are powerful because they can utilize the vast amounts of unlabeled operational data generated by PV systems.

          By learning from both a small set of labeled data and a large set of unlabeled data, semi-supervised models can achieve high performance without the prohibitive cost and effort of extensive manual labeling.
          This makes them a practical and cost-effective solution for bridging the data-scarcity gap in real-world applications.
    - Benefits of Semi-Supervised Learning Paradigms.
        - ### 4c1a11 - Hybrid Learning Models Enhance Adaptability in PV Fault Detection (Islam et al. 2023, Rahmoune et al. 2023)

          To move beyond the static nature of traditional supervised learning, hybrid algorithms are emerging as a more adaptive solution for PV fault detection.
          These models combine different learning paradigms, such as supervised learning with reinforcement learning.

          This combination allows the system to learn from labeled data while also dynamically adjusting its behavior based on real-time data streams and feedback (rewards).
          This reduces the strict requirement for a comprehensive, pre-existing labeled dataset and enables the fault detection system to evolve and fine-tune its performance over time.
        - ### 4c1a12 - Hybrid Methodologies Enable Cost-Effective PV Fault Detection (Ali et al. 2021, Dhanraj et al. 2021)

          Beyond technical performance, a crucial driver for adopting hybrid ML methodologies in the PV sector is cost-effectiveness.
          Sophisticated hybrid architectures lead to significant operational savings by enabling earlier and more reliable fault detection (Ali et al., 2021).

          By accurately identifying potential issues before they escalate into major failures, these systems reduce costly system downtime and streamline maintenance efforts.
          The integration of remote monitoring tools with real-time hybrid analytics further supports this by allowing for timely, targeted interventions that ensure the long-term efficiency and durability of PV installations (Dhanraj et al., 2021).
        - ### 4c1a14 - Hybrid Models Combine Unsupervised and Supervised Learning for Robust PV Fault Detection (Voutsinas et al. 2023, Lin et al. 2025)

          A promising strategy for improving the accuracy and reliability of PV fault detection is to create hybrid models that integrate both unsupervised and supervised machine learning techniques.
          This approach leverages the distinct strengths of each methodology.

          In a typical hybrid system, an unsupervised model is first used to perform broad anomaly detection, flagging any data that deviates from the norm.
          These potential faults are then passed to a supervised model, which classifies the specific type of fault, thereby reducing false positives and providing more detailed diagnostics (Voutsinas et al., 2023; Lin et al., 2025).
        - ### 4c1a15 - Hybrid Models for PV Fault Detection and Classification (Lin et al. 2025)

          A promising strategy to overcome the limitations of purely unsupervised models is to implement a hybrid design.
          This approach leverages the strengths of both unsupervised and supervised learning in a two-step process.

          First, an unsupervised model is used to scan operational data and flag any anomalies, which it can do without labeled data.
          Second, a supervised classification model, trained on any available labeled fault data, is used to categorize the specific anomalies detected by the first model (Lin et al., 2025).
          This method bridges the gap between anomaly detection and fault classification, creating a more effective and actionable system.
        - ### 4c1a16 - Hybrid Models Help Manage Imbalanced Datasets in PV Fault Detection (Pamungkas et al. 2023)

          Imbalanced datasets are a common and significant issue in PV fault detection, as data for normal operation vastly outnumbers data for specific faults.
          Hybrid approaches, particularly the use of coupled models, can effectively address this challenge (Pamungkas et al., 2023).

          By structuring the learning process, for instance, using one part of a hybrid model for feature learning and another for classification with class balancing, the system can avoid bias towards the majority (normal) class.
          This allows for more effective training and leads to higher sensitivity in detecting rare but critical fault events.
        - ### 4c1a17 - Hybrid Models Improve PV Fault Detection Accuracy (Kebir et al. 2021)

          A robust solution to the limitations of purely unsupervised models is to use a hybrid approach that combines unsupervised and supervised learning.
          In this framework, an unsupervised model first performs broad anomaly detection to identify any potential issues without needing labeled data.

          Once an anomaly is flagged, it is then fed into a supervised model, which uses labeled historical data to classify the specific type of fault (Kebir et al., 2021).
          This two-step process leverages the strengths of each method, improving both the accuracy and the interpretability of fault detection in PV systems.
        - ### 4c1a18 - Non-Supervised Methods Offer an Adaptive Alternative to Supervised PV Fault Detection (Qiao et al. 2024)

          To overcome the data-dependency of traditional methods, there is a growing trend towards using non-supervised learning for PV fault detection.
          These approaches, often utilizing deep learning, can perform diagnosis even with very limited labeled data.

          The key advantage is their enhanced adaptability.
          Non-supervised methods can identify novel or unforeseen faults without requiring extensive retraining on pre-labeled examples of that specific fault.
          This makes them inherently more robust and suitable for the dynamic and data-scarce reality of many operational PV settings.
        - ### 4c1a8b - Digital Twins Can Generate Synthetic Data to Train PV Fault Detection Models (Liu et al. 2024, Khosa et al. 2023)

          One promising method to overcome the lack of labeled fault data in PV systems is the use of digital twins to generate synthetic data.
          A digital twin is a virtual model of a physical PV installation that can simulate its behavior under various conditions.

          By using deep learning within these simulations, researchers can model numerous fault scenarios and generate large amounts of corresponding data.
          This synthetic data can then be used to augment real-world datasets, allowing for the training of more robust and accurate machine learning models that are exposed to a wider variety of fault conditions than what is available from physical data collection alone.
        - ### 4c1a8b1 - Generative Models Augment Scarce Datasets for PV Fault Detection (Lu et al. 2022)

          Generative models, particularly Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs), offer an innovative solution to the problem of data scarcity in PV fault detection. These models can learn the underlying distribution of existing fault data and generate new, artificial data points that are realistically similar.

          This synthetic data can then be used to supplement limited real-world datasets.
          By augmenting the training data in this way, supervised models can be trained more effectively, leading to improved robustness and better performance when faced with the wide variability of fault conditions in PV systems.
        - ### 4c1a8b1a - Generative Models Augment Scarce PV Fault Data (Lu et al. 2022, Seo et al. 2023)

          A sophisticated hybrid technique for overcoming data scarcity in PV fault detection involves using generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs).
          These models can learn the underlying patterns of real faults and then create synthetic, yet highly realistic, new data points (Lu et al., 2022; Seo et al., 2023).

          By generating artificial fault data that mimics various conditions, GANs can significantly augment limited training datasets.
          This allows for the training of more robust and accurate machine learning classifiers without the risk of overfitting that can occur when simply duplicating existing data.
          It's a powerful way to expand a model's exposure to diverse fault scenarios.
        - ### 4c1a8n - Transfer Learning Mitigates Data Scarcity in PV Fault Detection (Xu et al. 2020, Mansouri et al. 2021)

          Transfer learning is a vital hybrid technique for overcoming the common problem of limited labeled data in PV fault detection.
          This approach leverages knowledge from a model pre-trained on a large, well-labeled dataset and applies it to a new, smaller dataset specific to a particular fault diagnosis task (Xu et al., 2020).

          By fine-tuning a pre-trained deep learning model on the limited available fault data, researchers can achieve high diagnostic accuracy without the need to build a new model from scratch.
          This method significantly enhances a model's ability to provide actionable diagnostics in novel contexts where collecting extensive labeled data is impractical (Mansouri et al., 2021).
        - ### 4c1a8o - Unsupervised Learning Mitigates Labeled Data Scarcity in PV Fault Detection (Zhang et al. 2024, Xiaoni et al. 2024, Rahmoune et al. 2023)

          To address the challenge of limited labeled data for PV fault detection, researchers are increasingly turning to unsupervised and semi-supervised learning techniques.
          These methods do not require extensive, pre-labeled datasets to identify anomalies.

          By learning the patterns of normal system operation directly from unlabeled operational data, unsupervised models can detect deviations that may indicate a fault.
          This approach bypasses the bottleneck of manual data labeling, allowing for the development of robust detection systems even when labeled fault examples are scarce.
        - ### 4c1a8p - Unsupervised ML for PV Fault Detection Overcomes Labeled Data Scarcity (Ghazali & Sujod 2022, Rao et al. 2021)

          Unsupervised machine learning models are highly valuable for photovoltaic fault detection primarily because they do not require labeled data.
          Acquiring comprehensive labeled datasets that cover all possible fault scenarios in PV systems is often impractical due to high costs and labor intensity (Rao et al., 2021).

          Unlike supervised approaches that depend on pre-labeled examples of faults, unsupervised techniques can learn from raw, unlabeled operational data.
          This makes them particularly well-suited for PV systems where labeled fault data is scarce (Ghazali & Sujod, 2022).
        - ### 4c1a19 - Thermal Imaging Provides an Alternative Data Source for PV Fault Detection (Zhang et al. 2024, Fadhel et al. 2019)

          Leveraging alternative data sources is a key strategy for detecting PV faults without relying on large labeled datasets.
          Thermal infrared imaging, for example, allows for the direct observation of temperature anomalies on PV modules, which often indicate internal faults like hot spots.

          This approach bypasses the need for extensive electrical data by using image processing to identify faults.
          It is a form of unsupervised detection, as it identifies anomalies (hot spots) relative to the normal thermal signature of the array, rather than relying on pre-labeled examples of electrical fault data.
        - ### 4c1a3 - Combining Data Sources in Hybrid Models Improves PV Diagnostics (Qureshi et al. 2024)

          A powerful hybrid methodology for PV fault detection involves combining different data sources to create a more complete picture of system health.
          For instance, integrating infrared thermography (thermal images) with electrical telemetry data through a machine learning model provides a much richer basis for diagnosis (Qureshi et al., 2024).

          This dual-data strategy allows the model to correlate internal electrical anomalies with external thermal patterns, leading to more effective and reliable fault identification.
          This type of data fusion is especially critical for enhancing predictive maintenance strategies in large-scale PV installations where diverse and complex faults can occur.
        - ### 4c1a3a - Fusing Remote Sensing with ML Enables Robust PV Monitoring (Zhang et al. 2024, Gong et al. 2023)

          A promising frontier in PV fault detection is the fusion of remote sensing technologies with hybrid machine learning models.
          This approach combines remote heterogeneous data, such as thermal or optical satellite imagery, with sophisticated ML algorithms to create powerful, real-time monitoring systems (Zhang et al., 2024; Gong et al., 2023).

          This integration allows for the detection of physical anomalies (like hotspots or soiling) over large areas without direct physical inspection.
	          By feeding this rich, multi-modal data into an ML pipeline, it's possible to build robust diagnostic systems that operate with minimal human intervention, meeting the growing demand for automated, real-time performance monitoring.
        - ### 4c1a1 - Autoencoders Can Mitigate High Dimensionality in PV Data

          Autoencoders offer an effective strategy for managing the high dimensionality of PV sensor data. 
          This type of neural network can learn a compressed, lower-dimensional representation of the input data, effectively capturing its most essential features while filtering out noise and redundancy (Ibrahim et al., 2021; Martín et al., 2020).

          By first processing the data through an autoencoder, the resulting cleaner, feature-rich dataset can be fed into a subsequent classification algorithm. 
          This two-step process helps to improve model performance and significantly reduce the risk of overfitting associated with high-dimensional spaces.
        - ### 4c1a1b - Deep Learning Autoencoders Can Enhance Feature Extraction for PV Fault Detection

          One potential solution to improve PV fault classification is to use deep learning models like autoencoders for advanced feature extraction. 
          Autoencoders can process raw operational data and learn to represent it in a more condensed and meaningful way, potentially capturing subtle patterns that distinguish different fault types (Liu et al., 2024).

          However, the success of this approach hinges on the quality of the learned features. 
          To improve classification accuracy, the features extracted by the model must be sufficiently discriminative to resolve the nuanced differences between various fault conditions (Qiao et al., 2024).
        - ### 4c1a2 - BORE Addresses Key Challenges in PV Fault Detection Systems

          BORE's characteristics suggest strong potential for its application to PV fault detection systems. 
          PV systems often face challenges such as imbalanced data (faults are rare), the need to detect novel anomaly types, and real-time processing constraints. BORE is designed to handle these issues, making it a suitable candidate for reliable, budget-conscious PV monitoring systems.
        - ### 4c1a2a - BORE Combines Unsupervised OSFs with Supervised Learning for Outlier Detection

          BORE, or Bagged Outlier Representation Ensemble, is an outlier detection framework that combines unsupervised outlier scoring functions (OSFs) with a supervised learning approach. It is designed to address challenges like inherent class imbalance and the detection of novel types of outliers. The framework operates by training a classifier on a rich, non-linear feature representation derived from diverse OSF outputs.
        - ### 4c1a4 - Combining Deep Learning and Classical ML Improves Fault Classification Robustness

          Traditional fault detection methods in PV systems often focus on a narrow range of known fault scenarios, limiting their effectiveness. 
          A hybrid approach that integrates diverse learning techniques, such as combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with classical ML classifiers, enhances the robustness of fault classification (Aziz et al., 2020).

          This strategy leverages the strengths of both paradigms: CNNs excel at automatically extracting complex spatial and temporal features from raw data, while classical classifiers can make robust decisions based on these features. 
          This combination leads to improved diagnostic performance across a wider variety of fault types (Saeed et al., 2024).
        - ### 4c1a5 - Common Unsupervised Techniques for PV Fault Detection

          Several unsupervised machine learning techniques are applied to discern normal from faulty behavior in photovoltaic (PV) systems. 
          These methods analyze performance metrics without needing prior fault labels.

          Commonly used techniques include one-class support vector machines (SVM), principal component analysis (PCA), and various clustering algorithms. 
          For instance, PCA can be used to reduce the dimensionality of data and identify deviations, while clustering can group data points to separate normal operational states from anomalous ones, indicating potential faults (Natsheh & Samara, 2020; Et-taleby et al., 2023).
        - ### 4c1a5a - Computational Cost Can Limit Real-Time Application of Unsupervised PV Fault Detection

          The computational complexity associated with certain unsupervised algorithms can be a significant barrier to their use in real-time fault detection for PV systems. 
          Processing the large volumes of high-frequency data generated by PV arrays can be resource-intensive.

          This high computational demand may make some unsupervised methods impractical for immediate, on-the-fly fault detection where rapid responses are necessary. 
          The feasibility of these models in real-time applications often depends on the available computing power and the efficiency of the specific algorithm chosen (Natsheh & Samara, 2020).
        - ### 4c1a6a - Ensemble Learning Improves Robustness in PV Fault Detection

          Ensemble learning methods provide a robust approach to handling the complex and high-dimensional data from PV systems. 
          Instead of relying on a single model, an ensemble aggregates the predictions from multiple models to arrive at a final decision.

          This technique enhances overall accuracy and provides greater resilience against overfitting, which is a critical advantage when dealing with noisy, non-linear data (Mellit et al., 2023; Voutsinas et al., 2023). 
          Ensembles are thus well-suited to improve the reliability of fault detection in complex operational environments.
- **Value of Human Expertise:**
    - Crucial role of Domain Expert Feedback.
        - ### 3d - Expert Input is Crucial for Fault Detection in Large-Scale PV Systems

          Fault detection in large-scale PV systems is uniquely challenging due to the immense complexity and interconnection of components, which can lead to numerous and varied fault types. 
          Standard ML algorithms may struggle to adequately identify all potential failures in such vast systems (Pei & Hao, 2019).

          Incorporating expert feedback is crucial for modeling these large-scale complexities in a way that purely algorithmic solutions might overlook. 
          A cooperative relationship between the machine and the human operator allows the system's learning objectives to be refined over time, progressively improving diagnostic accuracy for the specific challenges posed by large, intricate installations.
        - ### 3d3 - Human Context is Essential for Interpreting Environmental Variables

          Machine learning models, while powerful at analyzing data, can struggle to correctly interpret the influence of complex environmental variables on PV system performance. 
          Human expertise provides the crucial interpretative context needed to make sense of these factors (Djeghader et al., 2022).

          An operator can discern whether a performance dip is due to a passing weather front, high ambient temperatures, or a genuine fault—a distinction a purely statistical model might miss. 
          This collaborative framework, which merges quantitative data analysis with qualitative human assessment, ensures that diagnoses are robust and grounded in the operational reality of the system (Eskandari et al., 2020).
        - ### 3d4 - Human Expertise Improves Generalization of ML Models

          Machine learning models like LSTMs and CNNs are adept at extracting features from PV data but may struggle to generalize their knowledge to new or unseen fault conditions. 
          Human experts play a vital role in overcoming this limitation by intervening to refine feature selection or adjust model parameters (Appiah et al., 2019; Garoudja et al., 2017).

          This human oversight ensures that the models remain robust and reliable when deployed across different operational contexts. 
          By validating model outputs and guiding the feature extraction process, experts help create more intelligent and adaptable fault detection systems that achieve high accuracy in real-world scenarios (Basnet et al., 2020). ^e6cf1c
        - ### 3d7 - Human Expertise Provides Essential Context for ML Models

          Human experts are invaluable in hybrid fault detection systems because they provide context that raw data alone cannot convey. 
          While ML models are trained on large datasets, these datasets may not capture every operational nuance of a PV system (Et-taleby et al., 2023; Garoudja et al., 2017).

          Domain specialists can interpret the impact of unique environmental factors, understand historical anomalies, and recognize subtle operational regimes. 
          This expert knowledge helps inform and refine ML models, ensuring their predictions are grounded in the physical reality of the specific PV installation, which ultimately improves diagnostic accuracy.
        - ### 3d8 - Human Experts are Key to Adapting ML Models Over Time

          Purely automated machine learning strategies can lack the robustness to adapt to new or evolving fault types that emerge over the lifespan of a PV system. 
          Human expertise is pivotal for the long-term success of these models by guiding their adaptation and recalibration (Tertytchny et al., 2019).

          Experts can identify when a model's performance is degrading and diagnose the cause, whether it's a new type of fault or a change in operating conditions. 
          By integrating this expert feedback into a continuous fine-tuning process, the hybrid system remains relevant and accurate, effectively handling the unforeseen variables common in PV operations.
        - ### 3d12 - Human-Led Feature Engineering Enhances ML Model Performance

          A synergistic hybrid strategy involves leveraging human expertise during the initial stages of feature engineering before training a machine learning model. 
          In this approach, domain experts use their knowledge to select and transform the most relevant input variables from raw data.

          This human-led feature extraction is then combined with ML algorithms like decision trees or support vector machines (SVMs), which excel at finding complex patterns within well-structured data (Yousefi et al., 2023; Balaji et al., 2024). 
          This collaboration ensures that the model's learning process is guided by expert knowledge, which enhances accountability, accelerates fault resolution, and improves overall diagnostic accuracy.
        - ### 3d15 - Integrating Human Expertise with ML Creates Effective PV Fault Detection

          A hybrid approach that balances machine learning (ML) automation with human expertise is crucial for designing efficient and accurate diagnostic tools for photovoltaic (PV) systems. 
          Faults like shading or degradation can cause significant efficiency losses, making reliable detection essential (Jaskie et al., 2021).

          While ML models offer powerful automation, human operators provide invaluable insights and contextual knowledge. 
          This synergy is necessary for creating robust diagnostic frameworks that can accurately assess the state of PV systems under the diverse and dynamic conditions found in real-world operations.
        - ### 3d16 - Integrating Human Expertise with ML is Crucial for PV Fault Detection

          A hybrid approach that balances machine learning (ML) automation with human expertise is crucial for designing efficient and accurate diagnostic tools for photovoltaic (PV) systems. 
          The complexity of PV operations means that automated models alone can be insufficient (Mellit et al., 2021).

          Human experts provide crucial oversight and domain-specific insights that refine and validate the performance of ML models like Artificial Neural Networks (ANNs) (Dhimish et al., 2018). 
          This synergy between automated analysis and human evaluation is necessary to handle the diverse and evolving challenges in real-world PV fault detection, enhancing both accuracy and trustworthiness.
        - ### 3d18 - Neuro-Fuzzy Systems Embody Human Expertise in Hybrid Models

          A powerful hybrid approach for PV fault detection involves integrating rule-based systems with machine learning, such as in a neuro-fuzzy classifier. 
          These systems formally encapsulate human expertise into a set of logical rules (the "fuzzy logic" component) and combine it with the adaptive learning capabilities of neural networks.

          This fusion allows the model to leverage both expert domain knowledge and data-driven patterns simultaneously. 
          As demonstrated by Dhimish et al. (2017), such hybrid systems can outperform pure ML approaches in accurately classifying various fault conditions, enhancing prediction accuracy while minimizing false alarms.
    - Transforming Anomaly Scores to Meaningful Fault Classifications.
        - ### 3d1 - Expert-Informed Thresholds Improve Anomaly Score Utility

          A practical and powerful application of the hybrid human-ML approach involves using expert knowledge to set informed thresholds for anomaly scores generated by algorithms. 
          An ML model can produce a statistical score indicating how much a data point deviates from the norm, but this score lacks inherent meaning.

          By incorporating expert domain knowledge, meaningful classification thresholds can be established to determine when an anomaly score is severe enough to trigger a maintenance alert or other action (Wang et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2022). 
          This dual focus—combining an AI-derived score with a qualitative, human-set threshold—effectively translates a statistical finding into a practical, risk-mitigated operational decision.
        - ### 3d5 - Human Expertise is Crucial for Interpreting Ambiguous ML Results

          Even advanced machine learning models like CNNs can fall short in ambiguous fault scenarios where algorithmic interpretation is unclear. 
          Human expertise is essential in these cases to provide oversight and prevent misdiagnoses that could lead to costly operational errors (Sairam et al., 2020; Eskandari et al., 2020).

          By complementing automated analysis with human judgment, hybrid systems gain a layer of reliability. 
          Experts can contextualize ambiguous outputs, validate model predictions against their domain knowledge, and ensure that the final diagnostic decision is sound, which is particularly important for complex or novel fault types.
        - ### 3d6 - Human Expertise is Essential for Interpreting and Acting on ML Results

          Even with the advent of advanced deep learning models like CNNs and LSTMs, there remains an essential role for human expertise in the final stages of the fault detection process. 
          Experts are needed to interpret the model's output, set practical and effective thresholds for alarms, and devise an appropriate maintenance response (Sarmiento et al., 2024).

          This fusion of automated analysis with human-driven decision-making is critical. 
          It transforms a simple fault alert into an actionable insight, enriching the overall maintenance strategy. 
          This synergy ensures that predictive analytics leads to tangible improvements in system reliability and operational efficiency.
        - ### 3d9 - Human Interpretation is Key to Classifying ML-Detected Anomalies

          A critical step in PV fault detection is transforming an abstract anomaly detected by a machine learning model into a meaningful, physical fault classification. 
          An ML algorithm might flag a drop in power output, but it often cannot distinguish the cause without additional context (Saeed et al., 2024).

          This is where human expertise becomes essential. 
          An experienced technician can provide the contextual knowledge—considering factors like weather, time of day, and maintenance history—to determine if the power drop is due to benign shading or a critical issue like panel soiling or an electrical fault (Haque et al., 2019). 
          This ensures anomalies are correlated accurately with physical causes, leading to actionable insights.

        - ### 3d10 - Human Oversight Improves Detection of Incipient Faults

          Standard machine learning models may not be sensitive enough to adequately detect incipient or subtle faults in their early stages. 
          Human oversight is critical to complement these automated systems by providing the contextual knowledge needed to identify these developing issues (Sairam et al., 2020).

          An expert can recognize faint patterns or minor deviations that an algorithm might dismiss as noise, especially if they have historical knowledge of the system's behavior. 
          This combination of automated screening and human validation significantly reduces response times and enhances the overall effectiveness of predictive maintenance efforts (Sairam et al., 2020; Al-Obaidi & Derbel, 2023).
        - ### 3d11 - Human-in-the-Loop is Often Necessary for Validating PV Faults

          Fully automated fault detection in PV systems is complicated by the nuances of operational data. 
          Purely automated ML models can struggle to distinguish true faults from complex operational variations or sensor noise, necessitating human intervention.

          A "human-in-the-loop" approach, where an expert validates the findings of the ML model, is often required to ensure accuracy (Ghazali & Sujod, 2022). 
          While this improves reliability, it hinders full automation and can slow down the fault management process, reducing overall system efficiency.
        - ### 3d13 - Hybrid Architectures Can Enhance ML Model Interpretability

          A key benefit of hybrid models in PV fault detection is their potential to improve the interpretability of complex predictions. 
          By using a mixed-model architecture, practitioners can gain actionable insights from otherwise "black box" algorithms.

          This can be achieved by pairing a powerful data analysis model (like a deep neural network) with a simpler model or statistical technique focused on explanation. 
          For example, blending statistical process control with machine learning not only detects faults but also provides understandable outputs that can directly guide maintenance decisions, bridging the gap between detection and action (Harrou et al., 2018).
        - ### 3d14 - Hybrid Human-ML Systems are Necessary for Complex PV Faults

          The growing complexity of fault types in photovoltaic (PV) systems, such as soiling and degradation, necessitates hybrid detection systems. 
          These approaches integrate the computational power of machine learning (ML) with the nuanced oversight of human experts to improve diagnostic accuracy and operational safety (Alrifaey et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2021).

          While automated algorithms are powerful, they have inherent limitations. 
          A hybrid framework that leverages both computational methods and human insight is essential for creating a more reliable and timely fault diagnosis process, which is critical for the operational reliability of modern PV installations (Et-taleby et al., 2023).
                - ### 3d17 - IoT Integration Enables Real-Time Human-ML Feedback Loops

          The integration of Internet of Things (IoT) technologies is vital for effective hybrid fault detection systems in PV installations. 
          IoT devices generate vast streams of real-time operational data, which can be processed by ML algorithms to yield immediate, actionable insights (Lazzaretti et al., 2020; Samkria et al., 2021).

          This creates a continuous feedback loop between the automated system and human operators. 
          The system flags potential issues in real-time, and operators can quickly validate and respond. 
          This synergy minimizes the risk of overlooking critical faults and significantly accelerates the response to identified problems, enhancing overall system reliability.

        - ### 3d19 - Non-Invasive Fault Detection Relies on Human-ML Synergy

          Non-invasive fault detection methods, such as those based on I-V curve analysis, perfectly illustrate the synergy between human operators and advanced ML models. 
          These techniques allow for the diagnosis of various fault types without requiring significant interruption to the PV system's operation (Huang et al., 2019).

          In this hybrid approach, ML models perform the initial, automated analysis of the I-V curve to detect anomalies. 
          Human experts can then intervene to analyze and interpret these flagged anomalies, adding a crucial layer of reliability to the diagnostic process without the need for costly and disruptive physical inspections (Khalil et al., 2020).

        - ### 3d20 - Visualization Tools are Essential for Human-ML Collaboration

          For a hybrid human-ML approach to be effective, visualization tools are essential. 
          These tools play a critical role in translating complex anomaly data and opaque model outputs into intuitive and understandable representations for human operators (Xia et al., 2020).

          Effective visualizations enable stakeholders to quickly grasp fault patterns, make more informed maintenance decisions, and build trust in the automated system. 
          Furthermore, this interaction creates a powerful feedback loop where operators can validate or correct model findings, which in turn helps to continuously refine both the ML algorithm and the operators' own knowledge base (Dhanraj et al., 2021).

## 4. Proposed Solution: BORE
- **Introduction of BORE:**
    - [[Bagged Outlier Representation Ensemble (BORE)]] as a novel semi-supervised framework.
- **Core Idea of BORE:**
    - Combining [[Unsupervised Fault Detection Systems]] into a robust ensemble.
    - Iterative refinement through [[Targeted Expert Labeling]].
    - Mechanism for [[Integrating Feedback in Ensemble Learning]].
## 5. Application Context & Data
- **Specific Application:**
    - Application to [[Real-World Data]].
    - Source: [[Large PV Plant Dataset]].
- **Suitability of Data Source:**
    - Challenges presented by [[PV Plant Data]]: volume, variety, subtle faults.
    - Demonstrating [[Efficacy on Real-World Scenarios]].
## 6. High-Level Methodology Overview
- **Two-Stage Process:**
    1. **Initial Unsupervised Ensemble Deployment:**
        - [[Preliminary Fault Indications]].
        - [[Unsupervised Anomaly Detection Phase]].
    2. **Feedback Loop & Labeling:**
        - Presenting indications to [[PV Plant Domain Experts]].
        - Process of [[Generating Fault Labels]].
    3. **Full BORE System Training & Refinement:**
        - Utilizing derived labels for [[Model Training and Validation]].
        - Transforming raw scores into [[Classified Fault Diagnoses]].

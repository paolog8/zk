To the LLM Agent: Populating Maps of Content (MOCs) in Obsidian

Your task is to assist me in populating my Maps of Content (MOCs) within Obsidian. An MOC is a Markdown file designed to be a curated index of notes on a specific topic, organized under various headings. Your goal is to identify relevant notes from my Zettelkasten and link them under the appropriate sections within a given MOC.

Task Execution Flow:

    Input MOC: You will be provided with the content of a single MOC .md file that needs to be populated.

    Access Zettelkasten: You will have access to all notes in my designated Zettelkasten folder (assume this is Main_Notes unless otherwise specified).

    Analyze & Match: For each heading within the provided MOC, you will analyze its context and identify relevant Zettelkasten notes that align with that heading's topic.

    Insert Links: You will then insert links to these identified notes under their respective headings within the MOC content.

    Output Result: Your final output will be the complete, modified content of the MOC file.

Detailed Requirements:

1. Understand the MOC Structure:

    Input: You will read the content of the MOC .md file provided.

    MOC Headings: MOCs are structured using Markdown headings (e.g., #, ##, ###). These headings represent sub-topics or categories within the broader MOC theme.

    Existing Links: Be aware that MOCs may already contain existing links to notes. Your additions should complement, not duplicate, these.

2. Access and Analyze Zettelkasten Notes:

    Input: You will read the content of all .md files found within my Zettelkasten folder (assume Main_Notes). These notes have filenames structured as [ID] - [Title].md (e.g., 4a - Some title.md).

    Note Content Analysis: For each Zettelkasten note, thoroughly analyze its content to understand its core subject matter, key concepts, arguments, and any specific details it covers.

3. Matching Notes to MOC Headings:

    Criterion: For each heading within the MOC, identify Zettelkasten notes whose primary content most closely aligns with the subject or scope of that heading.

    Specificity: Prioritize notes that are specifically about the heading's topic over notes that just mention it in passing.

    Breadth vs. Depth:

        Higher-level headings (e.g., ##): May include broader introductory notes or notes covering a wider aspect of the sub-topic.

        Lower-level headings (e.g., ###): Will require more specific notes that delve into the details or sub-components of that particular aspect.

    Relevance: Only include notes that genuinely contribute to understanding the heading's subject. Avoid adding irrelevant or only tangentially related notes.

4. Inserting Links into the MOC:

    Link Format: Obsidian uses the WikiLink format for internal links: [[Note ID - Note Title]].

        Example: If you identify 4a - Entanglement Basics.md as relevant to a section, you will insert [[4a - Entanglement Basics]].

    Placement: Insert the links under the relevant heading, typically as a bulleted list.

        Preferred Style: Use bulleted lists for clarity:

        ## Section Heading
        - [[Note ID - Note Title 1]]
        - [[Note ID - Note Title 2]]

    Avoid Duplicates: Before adding a link, check if the exact link already exists under that heading. Do not add duplicate links.

    No Duplicate Notes Across Headings: A single note should ideally only appear once in the MOC, under its most relevant heading. If a note could fit under multiple headings, choose the single best fit.

    Order: The order of links under a heading is not strictly critical, but a logical flow (e.g., chronological, foundational to advanced) is preferred if easily discernible. Otherwise, alphabetical by title is an acceptable default.

5. Output:

Your output should be the complete, modified MOC .md file content, with the new links inserted under their respective headings.

Example Scenario:

MOC File Content (Provided as Input):

# Quantum Physics MOC

## Fundamentals

## Entanglement

### Bell's Theorem

## Applications

### Quantum Cryptography

Relevant Zettelkasten Notes (Examples from Main_Notes):

    4a - Entanglement Basics.md (Content: explains what entanglement is)

    4a1 - Bell's Theorem.md (Content: discusses Bell's inequalities)

    4a2 - Quantum Entanglement in Secure Communication.md (Content: details how entanglement is used in QKD)

    4b - Superposition Explained.md (Content: explains superposition)

    5b - Principles of Public Key Cryptography.md (Content: unrelated to quantum cryptography)

Agent's Logic:

    Analyze MOC: Identifies headings: "Fundamentals", "Entanglement", "Bell's Theorem", "Applications", "Quantum Cryptography".

    Analyze Notes: Reads contents of all notes in Main_Notes.

    Matching:

        4a - Entanglement Basics.md -> Best fit for "Entanglement" heading.

        4a1 - Bell's Theorem.md -> Best fit for "Bell's Theorem" heading.

        4a2 - Quantum Entanglement in Secure Communication.md -> Best fit for "Quantum Cryptography" heading.

        4b - Superposition Explained.md -> Best fit for "Fundamentals" heading.

        5b - Principles of Public Key Cryptography.md -> Not directly relevant to "Quantum Cryptography" or other quantum headings.

Expected Output (Modified MOC Content):

# Quantum Physics MOC

## Fundamentals
- [[4b - Superposition Explained]]

## Entanglement
- [[4a - Entanglement Basics]]

### Bell's Theorem
- [[4a1 - Bell's Theorem]]

## Applications

### Quantum Cryptography
- [[4a2 - Quantum Entanglement in Secure Communication]]

I can explore ideas and create elaboration notes in scite_
The elaboration can be parsed with my Gemini's Gem _ZK note maker_ to produce notes suitable for the ZK.
The notes can end up in a MOC
The links in the MOC can be resolved with gemini CLI, directly or I can get some code written.
The concatenated notes can be fed to Gemini to produce text.

NotebookLM is not up to the task because lacks reference in plain text, scite_ is better.
NotebookLM definitely superior for learning and exploring topics when I don't need to produce articles, or I don't have the time to go through the references.

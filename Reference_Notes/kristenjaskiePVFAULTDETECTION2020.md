### Abstract
As solar panels become more ubiquitous, the need for automatic array management and PV fault detection becomes ever more important. PV array faults often create inefficiencies and can be hazardous. Traditional machine learning approaches to this problem require large amounts of labeled data from each panel array location. This data can be noisy, resource intensive, and expensive to obtain. Our approach uses new positive unlabeled learning techniques to dramatically reduce the amount of labeled training data required, while making use of readily available unlabeled data. Our method uses minimal training and achieves similar or better performance compared to fully supervised techniques. In this paper, we use a customized positive unlabeled learning algorithm called MLRf to demonstrate effective fault detection on the PVWatts dataset when only a small percentage of the labels are known.

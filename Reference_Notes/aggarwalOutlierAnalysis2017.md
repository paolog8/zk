[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PYG3ELT8?page=2&annotation=AUL4T2A8) “A binary labeling contains less information than a scoring mechanism, but it is the final result that is often needed for decision making in practical applications” ([Aggarwal, 2017, p. 2](zotero://select/library/items/DVMN9JBG))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PYG3ELT8?page=2&annotation=EU9UUHYL) “It is often a subjective judgement, as to what constitutes a “sufficient” deviation for a point to be considered an outlier. In real applications, the data may be embedded in a significant amount of noise, and such noise may not be of any interest to the analyst. It is usually the significantly interesting deviations that are of interest” ([Aggarwal, 2017, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/DVMN9JBG))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PYG3ELT8?page=3&annotation=NVP4U3UN) “the term “outlier” refers to a data point that could either be considered an abnormality or noise” ([Aggarwal, 2017, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/DVMN9JBG))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PYG3ELT8?page=3&annotation=VMFTVZMA) “an “anomaly” refers to a special kind of outlier that is of interest to an analyst” ([Aggarwal, 2017, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/DVMN9JBG))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PYG3ELT8?page=3&annotation=W6MEGDP3) “In the unsupervised scenario” ([Aggarwal, 2017, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/DVMN9JBG))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PYG3ELT8?page=3&annotation=Q76PCYK4) “the noise represents the semantic boundary between normal data and true anomalies” ([Aggarwal, 2017, p. 3](zotero://select/library/items/DVMN9JBG))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PYG3ELT8?page=4&annotation=PVFEFD65) “The crucial point to understand here is that anomalies need to be unusual in an interesting way, and the supervision process re-defines what one might find interesting” ([Aggarwal, 2017, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/DVMN9JBG))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PYG3ELT8?page=4&annotation=7JQFT2HZ) “Generally, unsupervised methods can be used either for noise removal or anomaly detection, and supervised methods are designed for application-specific anomaly detection” ([Aggarwal, 2017, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/DVMN9JBG))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PYG3ELT8?page=4&annotation=4FP6XN4A) “fully supervised scenario” ([Aggarwal, 2017, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/DVMN9JBG))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PYG3ELT8?page=4&annotation=45DMLVS4) “classification with positive and unlabeled data” ([Aggarwal, 2017, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/DVMN9JBG))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PYG3ELT8?page=4&annotation=H5LPBJKZ) “In other semi-supervised scenarios, only examples of normal data or only examples of anomalous data may be available” ([Aggarwal, 2017, p. 4](zotero://select/library/items/DVMN9JBG))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PYG3ELT8?page=5&annotation=7MRVWPAT) “contextual outliers” ([Aggarwal, 2017, p. 5](zotero://select/library/items/DVMN9JBG))

[Go to annotation](zotero://open-pdf/library/items/PYG3ELT8?page=7&annotation=QKWLX5LV) “An example in which the Z-value test would not work even as a heuristic, would be one in which it was applied to a data point that was an outlier only because of its relative position, rather than its extreme position. For example, if the Z-value test is applied to an individual dimension in Figure 1.1(a), the test would fail miserably, because point ‘A’ would be considered the most centrally located and normal data point. On the other hand, the test can still be reasonably applied to a set of extracted 1-dimensional values corresponding to the k-nearest neighbor distances of each point. Therefore, the effectiveness of a model depends both on the choice of the test used, and how it is applied” ([Aggarwal, 2017, p. 7](zotero://select/library/items/DVMN9JBG))

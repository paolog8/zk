Machine learning models, while powerful at analyzing data, can struggle to correctly interpret the influence of complex environmental variables on PV system performance. 
Human expertise provides the crucial interpretative context needed to make sense of these factors (Djeghader et al., 2022).

An operator can discern whether a performance dip is due to a passing weather front, high ambient temperatures, or a genuine faultâ€”a distinction a purely statistical model might miss. 
This collaborative framework, which merges quantitative data analysis with qualitative human assessment, ensures that diagnoses are robust and grounded in the operational reality of the system (Eskandari et al., 2020).

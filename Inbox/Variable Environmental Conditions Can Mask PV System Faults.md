The accurate detection of faults in a PV system can be complicated by environmental factors. 
In particular, inconsistent solar irradiation can obscure the performance data that would typically indicate a fault.

For example, a drop in power output caused by a hardware fault might be mistaken for a cloudy day. 
This masking effect makes it harder to diagnose underlying issues, allowing them to persist and worsen without intervention, especially in systems without advanced monitoring.

Leveraging alternative data sources is a key strategy for detecting PV faults without relying on large labeled datasets. 
Thermal infrared imaging, for example, allows for the direct observation of temperature anomalies on PV modules, which often indicate internal faults like hot spots.

This approach bypasses the need for extensive electrical data by using image processing to identify faults. 
It is a form of unsupervised detection, as it identifies anomalies (hot spots) relative to the normal thermal signature of the array, rather than relying on pre-labeled examples of electrical fault data.

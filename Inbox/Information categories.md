[cite:@justinsungHowRememberEverything2024] Identifies 5 categories of information, with distinct ways of digest it to improve retention.

* Procedural: best digested through practice, done as early and as often as possible
* Analogous: create analogies (helps [Simplify](Simplify.md)) and criticize them - How good is the analogy? When is it not valid? what aspects are not covered?
* Conceptual: best digested through mapping, as non-linear note-taking
* Evidence: This is information that supports other type of information, especially conceptual. Best digested by storing and rehearsing it.
* Reference: These are the nitty gritty details, for example the value of mathematical constants. As Evidence, this is best digested by storing and rehearsing it (for example with Anki).

The point of all digesting suggestions is to *train how you play*. For Evidence and Reference, this can be harder to figure out.

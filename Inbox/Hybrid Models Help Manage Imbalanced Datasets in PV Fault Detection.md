Imbalanced datasets are a common and significant issue in PV fault detection, as data for normal operation vastly outnumbers data for specific faults. 
Hybrid approaches, particularly the use of coupled models, can effectively address this challenge (Pamungkas et al., 2023).

By structuring the learning process, for instance, using one part of a hybrid model for feature learning and another for classification with class balancing, the system can avoid bias towards the majority (normal) class. 
This allows for more effective training and leads to higher sensitivity in detecting rare but critical fault events.

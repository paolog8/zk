In addition to false positives, unsupervised models for PV fault detection are also prone to false negatives, where a genuine fault goes undetected. 
This is particularly dangerous with incipient faults, as their subtle early signals can be lost within the patterns of normal operational data, causing the model to overlook them (Han et al., 2025).

The failure to consistently identify these nuanced deviations that signal a developing problem is a critical weakness (Han et al., 2024). 
A single false negative can allow a serious fault to develop unnoticed, increasing the risk of major system failure, safety hazards, and compromised energy production.

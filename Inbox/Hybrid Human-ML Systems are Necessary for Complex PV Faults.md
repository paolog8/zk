The growing complexity of fault types in photovoltaic (PV) systems, such as soiling and degradation, necessitates hybrid detection systems. 
These approaches integrate the computational power of machine learning (ML) with the nuanced oversight of human experts to improve diagnostic accuracy and operational safety (Alrifaey et al., 2022; Kim et al., 2021).

While automated algorithms are powerful, they have inherent limitations. 
A hybrid framework that leverages both computational methods and human insight is essential for creating a more reliable and timely fault diagnosis process, which is critical for the operational reliability of modern PV installations (Et-taleby et al., 2023).

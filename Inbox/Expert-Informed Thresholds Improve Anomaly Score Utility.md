A practical and powerful application of the hybrid human-ML approach involves using expert knowledge to set informed thresholds for anomaly scores generated by algorithms. 
An ML model can produce a statistical score indicating how much a data point deviates from the norm, but this score lacks inherent meaning.

By incorporating expert domain knowledge, meaningful classification thresholds can be established to determine when an anomaly score is severe enough to trigger a maintenance alert or other action (Wang et al., 2024; Xu et al., 2022). 
This dual focus—combining an AI-derived score with a qualitative, human-set threshold—effectively translates a statistical finding into a practical, risk-mitigated operational decision.

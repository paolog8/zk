A significant challenge in the advancement of perovskite solar cells is the fragmentation of research data. 
While valuable datasets exist for specific stages like synthesis or outdoor testing, they are rarely integrated to cover the entire research lifecycle.

This lack of comprehensive, end-to-end datasets prevents a holistic understanding of how initial material synthesis and manufacturing choices affect the final, real-world performance and durability of the cells (Tillmann et al., 2022; Li et al., 2017). 
Overcoming this fragmentation by creating integrated datasets is crucial for accelerating the technology's development and optimization.

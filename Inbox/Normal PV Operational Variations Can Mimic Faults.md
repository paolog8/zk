The performance of photovoltaic systems naturally fluctuates due to changing environmental conditions, such as solar irradiance and ambient temperature. 
These normal operational variances can produce data signatures that closely resemble those of actual faults, confusing unsupervised anomaly detection algorithms (Rao et al., 2021; García et al., 2022).

This mimicry makes it difficult for a purely data-driven model to delineate between a critical failure and a normal response to the environment (Raslan & Çam, 2020). 
Without the ability to account for these benign fluctuations, models can inaccurately flag normal conditions as faults, undermining their reliability.

Unsupervised algorithms are essential for effective fault detection systems.
Unlike supervised methods that rely on pre-labeled data, unsupervised approaches can identify any relevant [citation about deviations of interest in outlier analysis] deviation from normal operating conditions. 
This capability is crucial for real-world applications, where it's impossible to train a system on every conceivable fault.
By detecting novel anomalies, unsupervised learning ensures a robust and adaptable fault detection system that remains relevant over time.

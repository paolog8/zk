Tags: #EnsembleLearning, #Robustness, #Overfitting

Ensemble learning methods provide a robust approach to handling the complex and high-dimensional data from PV systems. 
Instead of relying on a single model, an ensemble aggregates the predictions from multiple models to arrive at a final decision.

This technique enhances overall accuracy and provides greater resilience against overfitting, which is a critical advantage when dealing with noisy, non-linear data (Mellit et al., 2023; Voutsinas et al., 2023). 
Ensembles are thus well-suited to improve the reliability of fault detection in complex operational environments.

The development and optimization of perovskite solar cells is a cyclical process that encompasses four distinct phases: synthesis, manufacturing, characterization, and outdoor testing. 
Each stage generates crucial data for understanding and improving the technology.

This structured research cycle allows for systematic advancements, where insights from later stages, like outdoor performance, can inform earlier stages, such as material synthesis.
However, the true potential of this cycle is often limited by data fragmentation between these phases.

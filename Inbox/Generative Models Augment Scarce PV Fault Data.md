A sophisticated hybrid technique for overcoming data scarcity in PV fault detection involves using generative models, such as Generative Adversarial Networks (GANs). 
These models can learn the underlying patterns of real faults and then create synthetic, yet highly realistic, new data points (Lu et al., 2022; Seo et al., 2023).

By generating artificial fault data that mimics various conditions, GANs can significantly augment limited training datasets. 
This allows for the training of more robust and accurate machine learning classifiers without the risk of overfitting that can occur when simply duplicating existing data. 
It's a powerful way to expand a model's exposure to diverse fault scenarios.

Traditional fault detection methods in PV systems often focus on a narrow range of known fault scenarios, limiting their effectiveness. 
A hybrid approach that integrates diverse learning techniques, such as combining convolutional neural networks (CNNs) with classical ML classifiers, enhances the robustness of fault classification (Aziz et al., 2020).

This strategy leverages the strengths of both paradigms: CNNs excel at automatically extracting complex spatial and temporal features from raw data, while classical classifiers can make robust decisions based on these features. 
This combination leads to improved diagnostic performance across a wider variety of fault types (Saeed et al., 2024).

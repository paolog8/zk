A powerful hybrid approach for PV fault detection involves integrating rule-based systems with machine learning, such as in a neuro-fuzzy classifier. 
These systems formally encapsulate human expertise into a set of logical rules (the "fuzzy logic" component) and combine it with the adaptive learning capabilities of neural networks.

This fusion allows the model to leverage both expert domain knowledge and data-driven patterns simultaneously. 
As demonstrated by Dhimish et al. (2017), such hybrid systems can outperform pure ML approaches in accurately classifying various fault conditions, enhancing prediction accuracy while minimizing false alarms.

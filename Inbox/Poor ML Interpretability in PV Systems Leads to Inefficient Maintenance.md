Tags: #MaintenanceStrategy, #FalsePositives, #Interpretability

The lack of clear interpretation from unsupervised fault detection models has direct negative consequences for PV system maintenance. 
The inability to understand the physical cause behind a flagged anomaly can lead to a high rate of false positives, where harmless operational deviations are mistaken for faults (Rao et al., 2021).

This ambiguity forces operators into a difficult position. 
They may perform unnecessary maintenance, wasting resources, or delay action due to uncertainty, which can lead to extended system downtime (Liu et al., 2024). 
Ultimately, this fosters a reactive, rather than proactive, maintenance strategy.

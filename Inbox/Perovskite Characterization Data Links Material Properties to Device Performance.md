Characterization data is essential for optimizing perovskite solar cells by creating a link between the material's physical properties and the device's overall performance. 
These datasets, though often isolated, provide deep insights into performance bottlenecks.

For example, studies have generated data identifying electronic traps and have shown how compositional tuning and thermal annealing can mitigate them to improve performance (Hwang et al., 2019).
Other characterization efforts have detailed the interplay between temperature and bandgap energy, which is critical for predicting and improving outdoor energy yield (Aydın et al., 2020).

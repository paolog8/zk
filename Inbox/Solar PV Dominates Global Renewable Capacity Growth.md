New solar capacity is projected to account for 80% of the growth in global renewable power between 2024 and 2030. This rapid growth is attributed to declining costs, shorter permitting timelines, and widespread social acceptance. China has been the primary driver of global renewable additions, accounting for two-thirds of the total in 2023. The country has already surpassed its 2030 target for solar PV and wind capacity six years early.

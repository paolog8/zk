To overcome the data-dependency of traditional methods, there is a growing trend towards using non-supervised learning for PV fault detection. 
These approaches, often utilizing deep learning, can perform diagnosis even with very limited labeled data.

The key advantage is their enhanced adaptability. 
Non-supervised methods can identify novel or unforeseen faults without requiring extensive retraining on pre-labeled examples of that specific fault. 
This makes them inherently more robust and suitable for the dynamic and data-scarce reality of many operational PV settings.

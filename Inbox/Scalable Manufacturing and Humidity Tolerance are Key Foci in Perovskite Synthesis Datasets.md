Datasets for perovskite solar cell synthesis and manufacturing primarily focus on enhancing scalability and environmental stability during fabrication. 
These efforts aim to transition the technology from laboratory-scale to industrial-scale production.

Research has produced datasets from scalable manufacturing methods, such as slot-die coating, that achieve high power conversion efficiencies (>22%) and demonstrate long-term outdoor stability (Li et al., 2023). 
Other studies contribute data on humidity-tolerant processes like roll-to-roll fabrication, which uses polymer additives to protect the perovskite material, making manufacturing more robust and suitable for large-area applications (Kim et al., 2019).

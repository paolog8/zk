Even with the advent of advanced deep learning models like CNNs and LSTMs, there remains an essential role for human expertise in the final stages of the fault detection process. 
Experts are needed to interpret the model's output, set practical and effective thresholds for alarms, and devise an appropriate maintenance response (Sarmiento et al., 2024).

This fusion of automated analysis with human-driven decision-making is critical. 
It transforms a simple fault alert into an actionable insight, enriching the overall maintenance strategy. 
This synergy ensures that predictive analytics leads to tangible improvements in system reliability and operational efficiency.

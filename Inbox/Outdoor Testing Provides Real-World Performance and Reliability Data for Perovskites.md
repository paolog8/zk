Outdoor testing is a critical phase in perovskite solar cell research, as it generates data on long-term performance and reliability under real-world, fluctuating environmental conditions. 
This data is indispensable for assessing the technology's commercial viability.

Datasets from these long-term tests are used to model energy yield and understand device reliability and longevity, revealing how cells behave beyond the stable conditions of a lab (Remec et al., 2024). 
This data also informs performance in specific use cases, such as building-integrated photovoltaics, providing a realistic evaluation of annual energy production (Nguyen et al., 2022).

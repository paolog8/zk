Tags: #IncipientFault, #FalseNegative, #UnsupervisedML

Incipient faults—those in their earliest stages—are particularly challenging for unsupervised models to detect in PV systems. 
The initial symptoms often manifest as very small deviations from normal operational data, making them easily confusable with standard system noise (Han et al., 2024).

Because unsupervised models lack historical, labeled examples of how faults develop, they may fail to capture these subtle but critical precursor patterns. 
This can lead to a failure to provide early warnings, allowing a minor issue to escalate into a significant failure before it is identified.

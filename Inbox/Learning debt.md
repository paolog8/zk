Some learning practices and techniques create a learning debt: something you do now for learning, actually defer the learning to some future time.
An example of this is flashcards: you create the flashcard now, but the actual learning happens once you have reviewed the card multiple times.
This creates a *learning debt* that you hope to *repay* in the future.
Problem is, this debt usually piles up the more you use the technique.

It would be better, in general, to use techniques that do not produce this debt: elaborating an idea, creating a mind map, these are process that create learning on the spot, the thinking that goes into them is learning.

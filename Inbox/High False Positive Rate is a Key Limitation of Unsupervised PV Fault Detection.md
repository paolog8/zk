A primary challenge in using unsupervised models for photovoltaic fault detection is their potential for a high rate of false positives. 
The anomalies identified by the model do not always correspond to actual system faults.

These false alarms can be triggered by benign operational variances or sensor noise that the model misinterprets as a fault. 
This can lead to unnecessary and costly maintenance actions, reducing the overall efficiency and practicality of the system (Basnet et al., 2020). 
Careful model tuning and feature selection are required to mitigate this issue.

Machine learning models like LSTMs and CNNs are adept at extracting features from PV data but may struggle to generalize their knowledge to new or unseen fault conditions. 
Human experts play a vital role in overcoming this limitation by intervening to refine feature selection or adjust model parameters (Appiah et al., 2019; Garoudja et al., 2017).

This human oversight ensures that the models remain robust and reliable when deployed across different operational contexts. 
By validating model outputs and guiding the feature extraction process, experts help create more intelligent and adaptable fault detection systems that achieve high accuracy in real-world scenarios (Basnet et al., 2020). ^e6cf1c

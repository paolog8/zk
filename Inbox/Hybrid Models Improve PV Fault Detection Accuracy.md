A robust solution to the limitations of purely unsupervised models is to use a hybrid approach that combines unsupervised and supervised learning. 
In this framework, an unsupervised model first performs broad anomaly detection to identify any potential issues without needing labeled data.

Once an anomaly is flagged, it is then fed into a supervised model, which uses labeled historical data to classify the specific type of fault (Kebir et al., 2021). 
This two-step process leverages the strengths of each method, improving both the accuracy and the interpretability of fault detection in PV systems.

Autoencoders offer an effective strategy for managing the high dimensionality of PV sensor data. 
This type of neural network can learn a compressed, lower-dimensional representation of the input data, effectively capturing its most essential features while filtering out noise and redundancy (Ibrahim et al., 2021; Martín et al., 2020).

By first processing the data through an autoencoder, the resulting cleaner, feature-rich dataset can be fed into a subsequent classification algorithm. 
This two-step process helps to improve model performance and significantly reduce the risk of overfitting associated with high-dimensional spaces.

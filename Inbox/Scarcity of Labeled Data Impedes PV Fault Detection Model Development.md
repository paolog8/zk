A significant barrier to improving fault detection in photovoltaic systems is the scarcity of comprehensive, labeled fault data. 
As PV installations become more common, the need for effective fault management grows, yet collecting diverse and accurately labeled datasets that capture the full range of real-world fault scenarios remains a major challenge.

This lack of sufficient labeled data directly hampers the development and training of effective machine learning (ML) models. 
Without robust datasets, creating reliable and accurate automated fault detection and diagnosis systems is difficult.

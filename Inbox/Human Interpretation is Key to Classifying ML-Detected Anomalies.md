A critical step in PV fault detection is transforming an abstract anomaly detected by a machine learning model into a meaningful, physical fault classification. 
An ML algorithm might flag a drop in power output, but it often cannot distinguish the cause without additional context (Saeed et al., 2024).

This is where human expertise becomes essential. 
An experienced technician can provide the contextual knowledge—considering factors like weather, time of day, and maintenance history—to determine if the power drop is due to benign shading or a critical issue like panel soiling or an electrical fault (Haque et al., 2019). 
This ensures anomalies are correlated accurately with physical causes, leading to actionable insights.

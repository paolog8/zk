Reading, or in general consuming information, with the aim of learning happens in two stages: the actual consumption (what goes in your brain) and then digestion (make the things consumed stay in your brain).

In order to have a productive learning, the two stages should be balanced.
What ends up happening is that consumption vastly overpowers digestion: we read a lot, watch a lot of videos, but very little ends up staying in our brain because we don't put in the effort to digest it properly.

The dynamic operating conditions of photovoltaic (PV) systems, particularly fluctuating sunlight and shading, are a primary source of false positives in fault detection algorithms. 
These environmental changes can cause significant variations in power output that traditional ML models mistake for actual system faults (Jaskie et al., 2021).

Many conventional algorithms fail because they treat each data point in isolation, without considering the system's historical performance or the broader environmental context. 
This lack of temporal and contextual awareness makes it difficult to distinguish between a genuine fault and a normal response to a change in conditions, such as a passing cloud. ^51e832
